Health director-general Datuk Dr Noor Hisham Abdullah said 800 inmates and 700 employees at the prison would be screened for Covid-19.    He said the prisoner, a foreigner, was detained as an undocumented worker since 2016 but left the prison on March 13.    He added that the prisoner had been transferred to the Malaysia Agro Exposition Park Serdang (MAEPS) quarantine centre for isolation and treatment.    \"If we detect a positive case, we will immediately conduct active case detection on those who have been exposed to the prisoner, including the employees at the prison.    \"The screening process is currently on-going,\" Dr Noor Hisham said during his daily press briefing here on Monday (June 1).

I wish to say that this is not true at all.    \u201cFor your information, I am currently undergoing quarantine at my home in Bukit Damansara, Kuala Lumpur,\" he said on his Facebook on Thursday (May 28).    Muhyiddin has been placed under a 14-day quarantine since last Friday (May 22), after attending a post-Cabinet meeting that was also attended by Auditor-General Datuk Nik Azman Nik Abdul Majid who later tested positive for Covid-19.    In 2018, he was in Singapore to undergo surgery for pancreatic cancer.    In his post, Muhyiddin said he would continue working on strategies to battle the pandemic still plaguing the country.    Meanwhile, he also said he had an online meeting with Senior Minister (Security) Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri Yaakob and Health director-general Datuk Dr Noor Hisham Abdullah to get the latest updates on the Covid-19 situation in the country.    \u201cIn the 40-minute meeting, a few matters were discussed, among them was having a campaign to encourage community leaders to empower their constituents with responsibilities to protect the community from the virus infection.    \u201cI believe this campaign will educate people to be more responsible for adhering the stipulated standard operating procedures (SOPs) and subsequently lessen the burden on frontliners.    \u201cThis is an important step in the exit plan for the conditional movement control order (MCO), which is also the last criteria to fulfil before the order can be lifted,\u201d he said, adding that the meeting also touched on repatriating undocumented migrants who have been tested negative for Covid-19.    He said he had directed that the process be quickened to reduce the risks of infection among the migrants at detention depots.    \u201cI am satisfied with the outcome in our efforts to fight the pandemic as briefed to me.    \u201cWith all citizens cooperating and taking responsibilities to take care of their own communities, I believe we will succeed in ending the Covid-19 chain of infection,\u201d he added.      \n                \n                "},

Health director-general Datuk Dr Noor Hisham Abdullah  (pic)  said 26 illegal foreign workers who are currently warded in Sungai Buloh hospital will be transferred to MAEPS.    \u201cWe have made a decision. For security reasons, the 26 Covid-19 positive illegal migrants would be transferred to MAEPS.    \u201cOnly the locals and legal foreign workers will be at Sungai Buloh hospital.    \u201cHopefully by doing so, we can improve the security at MAEPS and make sure we can provide good treatment to them,\u201d he said at his daily Covid-19 press briefing in Putrajaya on Saturday (May 30).    Dr Noor Hisham was responding to a question on a China Press report that a Covid-19 patient, who was an illegal foreign worker, had run away from Sungai Buloh hospital on Saturday morning (May 30).    \u201cNormally, when the (illegal migrants) are admitted to the hospital, they are accompanied by the Immigration officer and they are handcuffed in the ward.    \u201cBut, somehow, this 26-year-old Bangladesh national managed to escape,\u201d he said.    It was when the nurses were doing their rounds in the morning and they realised the patient was missing, he added.    \u201cWe took action and alerted the police and Immigration Department, and we managed to locate him.    \u201cNow he is back in the ward and we are looking into how he managed to escape when he was handcuffed,\" he said. \n                \n                "},

Instead, Aegile Fernandez \u2013 who has 37 years of experience in immigration and human-trafficking issues \u2013 said the government should work with NGOs, civil society and employers to educate migrant workers about the pandemic.    \u201cIf the undocumented foreign workers are treated with kindness, they will seek treatment if they are ill, \u201d she said.    Early this week, most of the Covid-19 clusters were discovered at three immigration detention depots and centres (DTIs) in Sepang, Bukit Jalil and Semenyih.    Health director-general Datuk Dr Noor Hisham Abdullah said that of the 172 cases tested positive in the country on Monday, 112 were from the DTIs.    The next day, 173 foreigners tested positive. Thirteen were security guards from Cheras.    The spike in cases, three-digit figures since May 3, has the public concerned but Dr Noor Hisham assured everyone that the DTIs were in isolated areas and under control by local authorities.    On the same day, Senior Minister Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri Yaakob said the government would send DTI detainees to Covid-19 makeshift hospitals and deport those who were free of Covid-19.    Infectious disease consultant Datuk Dr Christopher Lee concurred with Aegile.    \u201cIf we feel they are a major risk group based on their close living conditions, then we need to engage them rather than make them hide from the authorities, \u201d he said.    Dr Lee also said that if the undocumented workers had acquired the infection inside the camps, then the authorities needed to sort out the hygiene and social distancing issues there although it would pose a challenge due to the huge numbers.    \u201cEthically, we still have to try our best to minimise the risks, \u201d he said.    Universiti Malaya senior research consultant academician Emeritus Prof Datuk Dr Lam Sai Kit also said the Immigration Department should not detain undocumented migrants at this stage to prevent overcrowding.    \u201cDetainees should be educated on how the virus is spread and about personal hygiene, including wearing of face masks, \u201d he said.    However, consultant public health physician Datuk Lokman Hakim Sulaiman agreed with the authorities that detaining undocumented workers would help minimise Covid-19\u2019s spread to the general public and those tested negative should be deported.    \u201cWho will foot their bill if all undocumented workers are required to be tested?\u201d he said. \n                \n                "},

The Senior Minister said the government has assigned three facilities to house patients from the immigration depot clusters, with a total capacity of about 1,430 beds.    The three places are the Malaysia Agro Exposition Park Serdang (MAEPS), Hospital Sungai Buloh\u2019s leprosy centre and the unused maternity ward at Hospital Kuala Lumpur.    \u201cWe are ready. So far, we only have 230 patients at MAEPS. MAEPS can accommodate 600 patients.    \u201cIn total, all three facilities can put up 1,430 patients. So even if there is an increase in cases, we have enough places, \u201d he said at the National Security Council\u2019s daily Covid-19 press briefing here.    Ismail Sabri also defended the government\u2019s treatment of undocumented migrants throughout the Covid-19 pandemic.    He said those without documents were of illegal status in the country no matter what, adding that it was the Immigration Department\u2019s duty to manage them.    \u201cNothing changes their status. They entered the country illegally and do not have any right to be here. We are in talks with their home countries to take them back. We do not even want to jail them here, \u201d he said.    Ismail Sabri said foreign workers \u2013 whether legal or illegal \u2013 have been treated humanely by the Malaysian government.    \u201cForeigners with valid work permits are protected. For example, those working in the estates are given housing. Those in other sectors get all kinds of benefits from employers.    \u201cWe take care of their welfare. No issue. We acknowledge that we need them for the 3D jobs.    \u201cAs for those who entered the country illegally, we have to take action against them.    \u201cEven then, we do it humanely. When we find that some of them are Covid-19 positive at our depots, we screen all of them 100%, so that they can be saved.    \u201cWe send them to MAEPS to be treated. If you check out MAEPS, it is such a nice place and the government has spent millions of ringgit to set it up (as a Covid-19 hospital), \u201d he said.    On a related matter, Ismail Sabri, who is also Defence Minister, said 824 motorists that attempted interstate travel without permission on Tuesday were told to turn back - an increase from the 738 attempts recorded the day before.    He said the police has also detained 136 individuals, of which 75 were remanded while 61 were on bail for defying the conditional movement control order (MCO).    \u201cCompounds were also issued to 534 individuals for various offences under the conditional MCO, \u201d he said.    States that recorded the highest number of attempts to cross borders are Selangor (284), Kedah (122) and Melaka (113).    Ismail Sabri also said that audit firms that instructed their staff to work in different states were breaching the conditional MCO.    \u201cAs I have mentioned previously, interstate travels are only for emergencies such as a death or for close family members to visit those who are very ill.    \u201cAuditors wanting to check accounts of (their clients) is obviously not part of it. An audit isn\u2019t even an emergency, \u201d he said.    Ismail Sabri advised companies to hold online interviews for individuals who were in different states. \n                \n                "},

Its executive director Datuk Shamsuddin Bardan said the government\u2019s decision to enforce the amendment to the Workers\u2019 Minimum Standards of Housing and Amenities Act on June 1 was insensitive and did not take into account the problems faced by employers.    \u201cInstead, the government should assist employers by guiding them and workers on how Covid-19 can be prevented at their quarters.\u201d    The amendment will now include workers from all industries, including construction, with a three-month grace period granted to employers to implement it.    Shamsuddin said the minimum space requirement per worker living in a permanent dwelling is 4.8sq m while temporary dwelling is 3sq m.    \u201cThe space required for individual employees is demanding and costly and yet the maximum allowable charge on accommodation currently is only RM50 per worker, way below the centralised housing cost of RM100 to RM150 at market rate.    \u201cSome employers may have to send home some foreign workers because they don\u2019t have enough financial resources to comply with it,\u201d he said, adding that the government should target undocumented workers in which most Covid-19 cases were detected.    He also said that the grace period was too short as they were trying to cope with the requirements under the conditional movement control order to revive businesses.    Shamsuddin said providing \u201ckongsi\u201d type accommodation at construction sites would no longer be feasible under the new law.    \u201cAccommodation will be further away from construction sites and there is a need to provide transportation, which adds cost and travel time,\u201d he said.    However, Malaysian Medical Association president Dr N. Ganabaskaran welcomed the government\u2019s move, saying that workers should not be living in cramped rooms and a limit must be set on the number of workers per room.    \u201cPhysical distancing and good personal hygiene must be observed. Their accommodation must also be kept clean and disinfected,\u201d he said.    Dr Ganabaskaran said employers should also appoint team leaders to ensure preventive measures were enforced as part of the standard operating procedure (SOP).    \u201cRegular checks at construction sites and foreign workers\u2019 accommodation should be conducted by the authorities,\u201d he said, adding that fines should be issued for non-compliance.

Meanwhile, state health, welfare, women empowerment and family committee chairman Dr Siti Mariah Mahmud said RM2.06mil has been allocated by the Selangor government for screening of high risk groups.    \u201cWe\u2019ll be having a meeting with Mentri Besar Datuk Seri Amirudin Shari, the state health department as well as Selangor Task Force for Covid-19 on June 1 to determine all the high risk groups for screening, \u2019\u2019 said Dr Siti Mariah.    She added that PPEs were also being produced by the state\u2019s Women Development Centre in collaboration with Hospital Banting.    In Sabah, things are rough. Many construction sites are not running due to employers\u2019 inability to get their workers tested for Covid-19.    Sabah Builders Association (SBA) president Lou Chi Nam said that feedback from SBA\u2019s 100-odd members was that most of them would not begin work until June \u2013 and if the conditional MCO were to be over.\u201cOne of the requirements to start operating is that these workers must have gotten tested for the virus and results obtained, \u201d he said. \u201cBut since many are not able to, mainly due to the cost, they cannot operate, \u201d he said.    Lou said those who could afford to pay for their workers\u2019 swab tests also had to wait for a long period as there was a limit to the number of tests health officials could conduct in a day. \n                \n                "},

For the next few days, the figure is expected to increase, as pending test results are being finalised, says Health director-general Datuk Dr Noor Hisham Abdullah.    He said 172 more positive cases were recorded as of noon Monday (May 25), bringing the total cases in Malaysia to 7,417 cases.    ''Five of them were imported cases. Out of the 167 local transmissions, 159 involved non-citizens, where 112 were detected at three immigration detention centres,'' he said during the daily press briefing on the Covid-19 pandemic at the Health Ministry here on Monday.    There are a total of 18 detention depots under the Immigration Department nationwide, he said, including four temporary detention centres.    ''We have screened three of the centres - Semenyih, Bukit Jalil and Sepang.    ''Everyone, including the detainees and staff were screened, just like how it's done at areas where the enhanced movement control order (MCO) has been implemented,'' he said.    Dr Noor Hisham said a new cluster has been detected at the Sepang detention depot, where 1,346 detainees have been screened and 36 were tested positive.    ''A total of 873 samples are still awaiting test results,'' he said, adding that 540 from the total 1,449 samples taken from the centre have tested negative.    At the Bukit Jalil detention depot, 1,422 samples have been taken from the detainees and 126 have tested positive, with 896 samples pending.    As for the Semenyih detention depot, he said 1,757 samples have been taken, involving 1,630 detainees and 127 staff.    ''A total of 66 have tested positive, including a staff member.    ''We are still investigating if the staff member contracted the virus from the detainees or the community,'' he said, adding that officers and personnel from all three affected detention depots had been quarantined and replaced by new staff.    ''Disinfection has been done, so is screening and investigation. There\u2019s a possibility the infection could have been due to confined spaces,\u201d he added.    There are 227 positive cases from the three detention depots involving undocumented migrants so far, with those from Bangladesh recording the highest number at 53 cases.    The rest is followed by India (41), Indonesia (38), Myanmar (37), Pakistan (28), China (17), Cambodia (4), Nepal (3), Sri Lanka (2) and one each from the Philippines, Libya, Egypt and Syria.    Dr Noor Hisham, however, advised the public not to worry about the increase in the number of positive cases detected at the detention depots, as the premises are in isolated areas and under surveillance by the authorities.    ''The ministry will continue to cooperate with the Immigration Department, the police and other government agencies to manage the cases involving detention depots.    \"For example, (we conduct) investigation, close contact tracing, risk assessment by relevant agencies, active screening for symptoms and samples for case detection and education.    ''The positive cases are isolated and treated at hospitals, and close contacts are placed under observation and surveillance, '' he said.    Meanwhile, Dr Noor Hisham said this year's Hari Raya, albeit celebrated in a closed-door manner, is also very much unique.    ''We are celebrating Aidilfitri in a closed-door manner, but our hearts remain open.    ''God willing, we will break the chain of infection. I hope all Malaysians will adhere to the standard operating procedures while celebrating,'' he added.        \n                \n                "},

The Health director-general said that the whole of government and whole community approach should work together to fight the virus.    \u201cAs the virus ravages these centres, we need to enhance active case detection, isolate and treat those positive cases immediately.

Ismail said that Malaysians who were previously quarantined at MAEPS were transferred to Hospital Sungai Buloh on Sunday (May 24).    MAEPS was initially tasked as a Low-Risk Patient Quarantine and Treatment Centre for Covid-19 cases.    \u201cWe will isolate them from the rest of their friends in the depot to ensure the virus doesn\u2019t spread among other detainees, \u201d he said during his daily briefing on the conditional movement control order (MCO) on Monday (May 25).    Ismail also said that there is a need to segregate locals from undocumented migrants, adding that barbed wires had been placed around MAEPS.    \u201cFor Malaysians, we don\u2019t have to use barbed wires because they don\u2019t escape. The ones who try to escape are undocumented migrants and that is why we placed barbed wires there.    \u201cOnce they escape, it will be hard to track them down, because they have no documents and we don\u2019t know their addresses and who are their relatives.\u201d    MAEPS has the capacity to house 600 patients and is managed by the National Disaster Management Agency (Nadma), Fire and Rescue Department, Civil Defence Force, Social Welfare Department and the Public Works Department.    Meanwhile, Ismail said Malaysians should not be worried of the drastic hike in Covid-19 figures at immigration depots.    \u201cMalaysians should not be worried because they (migrants) are already confined in that depot area. So, chances for the virus to spread out of the depot is almost non-existent.\u201d    Ismail also said detainees and depot staff would be screened, and those who were found positive would be sent straight to MAEPS.    He added that a total of 4,342 undocumented migrants, consisting of 1,654 at the Semenyih Immigration Depot, 1,334 at the Bukit Jalil immigration depot, and 1,358 at the Sepang immigration depot, would be undergoing Covid-19 screening.    \u201cThose who are found negative will stay (at their respective depots).

At a press conference held on May 22, Senior Minister Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri Yaakob stated that the 60 confirmed positive cases in Bukit Jalil have been in the centre before the movement control order (MCO) took effect on March 18, and that all 114 of the Immigration officers on duty have tested negative.    While the government has stated that it will be screening detainees, testing alone is not a foolproof measure of preventing the spread of the virus. If the testing is only done once, there is no guarantee that the person would be free from infection, as the infected person may test negative because the test is unable to detect new exposure to infection within five days.    We are aware that three weeks are sufficient to trigger two to three generations of the spread of the virus. Given the pre-existing cramped conditions in the centres and the pressure that will be placed on the infrastructure with more detainees being brought in, we have grave concerns regarding the government\u2019s ability to prevent the transmission of disease.    Contrary to prevailing logic, the government\u2019s punitive approach toward undocumented migrant workers and refugees during this time of crisis poses a public health risk \u2013 for example, some individuals attempted escape from enhanced MCO areas. It also hurts the local economy as many sectors do rely on such workers for their day-to-day operations. It further puts Immigration officers at grave risk of contracting the disease and transmitting it to their family members.    Regrettably, the arrests of undocumented migrant workers by the government at this time has also had another inadvertent impact: It has made immigrant communities distrustful of the health system. This erodes the tremendous efforts made by the Health Ministry to combat this pandemic.    Civil society groups worked hard to be the bridge between immigrant communities and the government to build trust in the health system, which is critical to controlling this outbreak. Upon assurances from the Health Ministry in the early days of the pandemic, they encouraged immigrant and refugee communities to come out for Covid-19 screening voluntarily and without fear. Although non-citizens and the trust they place in a country\u2019s health system may not appear to be a matter of importance from a legal point of view, it is critical from a public health perspective in arresting the spread of disease. Non-health-related ministries need to understand the importance of respecting public health principles while we are in the midst of an outbreak of a disease that has no proven treatment, and that relies critically on prevention of disease transmission to stop spreading.    In this connection, the government must remember that as a member of the global community, the United Nations and the World Health Organisation, it has a higher duty of care towards incarcerated people as well as an obligation to control the spread of the pandemic regionally and globally. The detection of Covid-19 in deported immigrants, as in the case of the immigrants from Myanmar, does not augur well for Malaysia\u2019s international reputation. This is the time for nations to show solidarity and support for battling what is a global pandemic.    Finally, it cannot be over-emphasised that taking care and monitoring the health of large immigrant communities in the country is a way to also protect co-existing local communities.    As such we urgently call upon the government to:    >  Immediately stop the arrests of undocumented immigrants, refugees and asylum seekers as well as stateless persons without documents.    >  Allow the Health Ministry to take the lead in efforts to control the spread of Covid-19, including among non-citizens, and support the ministry in its efforts to combat the pandemic.    >  Invite Suhakam (the Human Rights Commission of Malaysia) to undertake a monitoring visit to detention centres to provide an independent report of the events leading to the detection of Covid-19 cases in them, and to ensure that strong preventive measures are being taken to control disease transmission in the centres.    >  Cooperate with international agencies and civil society organisations to increase detainees\u2019 access to hygiene products and other necessary supplies and to allow the UN High Commission on Refugees to identify and register Persons of Concern.    >  Develop a coherent and rational migration policy framework that links with an effective blueprint of the country\u2019s human resources needs.    >  Preserve the rule of law by taking action against xenophobic hate speech against immigrant communities whose contributions over the years have built this country.

South Korea\u2019s Centre for Disease Control and Prevention on Tuesday (May 26) also reported two more deaths, bringing national totals to 11,225 and 269 fatalities. Officials linked three of the new cases to international arrivals. South Korea has been reporting around 20 new cases per day over the past two weeks after health workers found hundreds of infections linked to clubgoers who went out in early May as the country eased on social distancing. The caseload has slowed from early March when it was reporting hundreds of new cases a day, but the new infections in the greater capital area has caused concern as authorities proceed with a phased reopening of schools, which began with high school seniors last week. Around 2.4 million high school juniors, middle school seniors, first- and second-grade elementary school children and kindergartners will be returning to school on Wednesday. Health Minister Park Neung-hoo during a virus meeting urged school officials to double-check their preventive measures. He called for authorities to strengthen monitoring on some 390,000 undocumented foreign nationals who may have poor access to medical services and tests, but related measures weren\u2019t immediately announced. South Korea also Tuesday began requiring people to wear masks on public transit and while using taxis. People in South Korea, like in much of Asia, have generally worn masks in public settings and no major disruptions were reported. Health authorities have left mask enforcement to bus drivers and subway station workers. Taxi drivers are allowed to refuse picking up passengers if they aren\u2019t wearing masks. South Korea since March has banned the exports of masks and channelled most domestically produced masks to pharmacies, where people are currently limited to buying three masks per week. The nationwide rationing was a drastic attempt at calming public anger over shortages, but supply has stabilised. - AP\n                \n                "},

If we allow them to be free, then it is wrong because they are illegals.    \u201cWe are not taking advantage of them. We send them to our detention depots. If they test negative for Covid-19, we will deport them.    \u201cIt is not nice to accuse Malaysia of mistreatment. In fact, other countries treat them (undocumented migrants) worse.

The Malaysian authorities have swept up hundreds of undocumented workers in raids amid its movement control order, while its neighbour Indonesia, home to most of them, is repatriating its citizens. Just as Singapore has struggled to deal with a coronavirus outbreak that spread quickly through its population of foreign workers in dormitories, countries with large numbers of low-wage migrant workers are grappling with similar issues. From Asia to the Middle East, the Covid-19 (coronavirus) pandemic is exposing the unique vulnerabilities of the world's estimated 164 million low-paid migrant workers, who toil at the jobs locals do not want, to save money and get a leg up back home. While some appear to have escaped the same sort of outbreak Singapore is dealing with, activists say good examples of how to manage this segment of their population are few and far between. As Covid-19 takes its toll on economies and public health in many countries, low-wage migrant worker populations have largely been affected disproportionately. Observers say problems include poor living conditions, insufficient legal protection and limited access to healthcare. Last month, Saudi Arabia had shipped home nearly 3,000 of the estimated 200,000 Ethiopians living there before the United Nations called for a halt. In Kuwait last month, at least a dozen migrant workers took their own lives or attempted to, according to migrant-rights.org, an activist website, citing media reports. In Thailand, hundreds of thousands of workers from neighbouring countries like Myanmar, Laos and Cambodia are said to have fled home after a lockdown left them with the prospect of being stuck without money or food. n Malaysia, police rounded up 200 undocumented workers last week alone in Petaling Jaya, outside Kuala Lumpur, even as officials gradually ease movement restrictions. The country is thought to have at least five million migrant workers. Indonesia, one of the world's biggest contributors of labour, has repatriated more than 130,000 of its citizens working abroad as construction workers, cruise ship staff and housekeepers, as well as students. David Welsh, country director of the South-East Asia branch of the Solidarity Centre, a non-profit organisation aligned with the United States-based labour federation AFL-CIO, said the crisis has exposed the poor conditions many migrant workers face. \"Migrant workers have been left aside by governments who have relied on them to do dangerous jobs that have become even more dangerous during this crisis,\" Welsh said. Then, there is Qatar, where observers say criticism of the country's treatment of migrant labour in the wake of its successful bid to host the Fifa World Cup in 2022 has sparked changes that are a lesson to others but also a demonstration of how difficult the process is going to be. Like in Singapore, the outbreak in Qatar has centred on its foreign workers, who outnumber Qataris in the workforce by nearly 20 to one. Total infections have ticked past 40,000 in a country with 2.8 million people. Last October, it abolished exit visas for departing workers and did away with discriminatory laws assigning minimum wages by nationality. The monarchy at the same time abolished the sponsorship rules that tie workers to jobs and make them vulnerable to abuse. The country's new minimum wage laws also override bilateral agreements with countries of origin that can see a Bangladeshi welder, for example, earning two-thirds what a Filipino might. Qatar's ambition to host the World Cup has helped prompt the changes. Shortly after securing the event a decade ago, Qatar publicly promised four weeks' paid leave, overtime and other benefits to workers employed by the contractors awarded work. Contractors erecting more than half a dozen stadiums and other needed infrastructure offer workers attractive terms that meet the scrutiny of activists and unions. Apolinar Tolentino, regional representative for the Building and Wood Workers' International Asia-Pacific, said his union has had regular access to inspect work sites and dormitories where workers are housed four to an air-conditioned room and bunk beds are banned. The visits included group interviews with workers to assess conditions including health and safety, food quality and even Internet speeds. \"Qatar is setting an example in the region of how to treat its migrant labour,\" said Tolentino. But he acknowledges that the improvement has not been even. Earlier this month, the government began easing a two-month lockdown of the sprawling Industrial Area outside of Doha, where hundreds of thousands of workers were holed up in dormitories. The government requires all employers to pay furloughed workers, but there have been reports of workers stranded and begging for food. The problem is fuelled in part by undocumented foreign workers relying on short-term casual work, who do not have regular employers. \"Compliance with standards outside the World Cup projects are more challenging,\" Tolentino said. \"There is almost no direct access by international organisations.\" Last month, Amnesty International and a coalition of non-governmental organisations and trade unions sent letters to Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Bahrain, Kuwait and Oman, raising concerns about migrant workers. Amnesty International's Middle East research director Lynn Maalouf said: \"While some governments made promising commitments to support migrant workers, much more needs to be done to ensure Covid-19 will not result in further human rights violations and greater suffering for migrant workers in these countries.\" - The Straits Times/Asian News Network\n                \n                "},

Federation of Malaysian Manufacturers (FMM) president Tan Sri Soh Thian Lai said the amendments to the Minimum Standards of Housing and Amenities (Amendment) Act was a good decision in the long term as it would ensure conducive housing condition for all workers, and enhance the health and productivity of the workforce in the country.    However, Soh said the amendments, which would come into force on June 1 in Peninsular Malaysia and the Federal Territory of Labuan, could pose some challenges to fulfilling them.    The Human Resources Ministry said the government would give a three-month grace period until Aug 31 to give room for employers to make the necessary arrangements.    The enforcement under the Act will begin on Sept 1. The amendments to the Act was passed in Parliament last July and was gazetted on Sept 18.    \u201cBut with the huge number of foreign workers in Malaysia, around two million documented and about four million undocumented, it could pose a big challenge to fulfil conditions under the amendments of the Act within 15 months, including the three-month grace period as all affected employers who employ foreign workers must comply with it, \u201d said Soh.    \u201cNow that the highest risk clusters of Covid-19 infections are foreign workers, this Act is timely \u2013 but it\u2019s too short a time to get the employers prepared.    \u201cWe urge the authorities to give more time, at least six months, for companies to reset and rearrange according to the standard operating procedure (SOP), \u201d Soh said.    Soh said the government should now focus on the construction sites and quarters of foreign workers in the yellow and red zones as they were the high-risk clusters.    \u201cThe most important thing is for all companies with foreign workers to follow the SOP set by the Health Ministry and authorities to minimise the risks, \u201d he said.    Master Builders Association of Malaysia (MBAM) president Foo Chek Lee said it was in full support of the implementation of the amendment, which it helped to draft years ago.    \u201cA worker needs a good place to stay and rest.    \u201cIf they don\u2019t have proper rest, they can\u2019t work and if their living condition is not good, they will get sick and it affects productivity, \u201d he said.    Foo said big construction companies would not have problems to provide housing according to the guidelines.    He pointed out that some workers, however, were labourers who did not have permanent employment and chose to live in cramped conditions to save money.    \u201cThe main contractor and project owners are liable to provide proper accommodation to foreign workers.    \u201cHowever, some sub-contractors may still resort to providing housing in the form of kongsi or hostel but now they would have to follow the guidelines under the amendments, \u201d he said.    Foo, however, said the grace period was tight as it did not give much time for companies to prepare.    \u201cBut this is an extraordinary time with Covid-19, so companies will have to push and make it happen to safeguard public health, \u201d Foo added.    Real Estate and Housing Developers Association (Rehda) national council member Tony Khoo Boon Chuan said there was confusion on the ground as the detailed SOP was not available.    When asked on the ramification of the amendments, Khoo said the extra cost from providing housing, according to guidelines, would be transferred to home buyers eventually.    \u201cThis will result in more expensive houses and properties, \u201d he said.    Bina Puri Holdings group executive director Matthew Tee said although the amendments came at a cost, the industry would have to manage it.    \u201cWe try to follow the guidelines but all these implementations come at a cost, at a time when the construction sector is undergoing a recession, \u201d said Tee. \n                \n                "},

Its president Dr N. Ganabaskaran said more emphasis should be given to safe physical distancing, the wearing of face masks and personal hygiene among the workforce, with testing focused on foreign workers in line with Ministry of Health\u2019s (MOH) targeted approach to testing.    He said while testing for Covid-19 is important, more emphasis should be placed on preventing exposure to risks of infections.    \"A person may receive a negative test result and still be exposed to infections the very same day after testing if preventive measures such as physical distancing and personal hygiene are not observed. With the increase in the number of Covid-19 infections among foreign workers (legal, illegal and undocumented), it is necessary to test this group with data entered into a registry,\u201d he said in a statement Monday (May 25).    He said the majority of foreign workers in the country stay in overcrowded, cramped dormitories, construction site cabins, shop lot rooms, terrace houses or apartments where physical distancing and personal hygiene may be almost impossible to observe.    \"An SOP (standard operating procedure) alone for foreign worker accommodation may also be needed along with random checks by the authorities. While testing of foreign workers will be necessary, steps must be taken to address the living conditions of foreign workers,\u201d he added. - Bernama                \n                \n                "},

Kuala Lumpur mayor Datuk Nor Hisham Ahmad Dahlan said the blitz was carried out following enforcement officers\u2019 investigation as well as tip-off from business owners and the public.

He added that the public need not worry about the rise in Covid-19 cases as those who had tested positive were already in the detention centres.    \u201cIt is almost impossible for the virus to spread from the centres to elsewhere because the cases have been contained within the centres.    \u201cWe have conducted tests on all the undocumented migrants and the officers at the depots.

Health director-general Datuk Dr Noor Hisham Abdullah said another 172 positive cases were recorded as at noon yesterday, bringing the total cases in Malaysia to 7,417.    \u201cFive of them were imported cases. Out of the 167 local transmissions, 159 involved non-citizens, where 112 were detected at three immigration detention centres,\u201d he told reporters yesterday.

The rest are from India (41), Indonesia (38), Myanmar (37), Pakistan (28), China (17), Cambodia (4), Nepal (3), Sri Lanka (2) and one each from the Philippines, Libya, Egypt and Syria.    Dr Noor Hisham, however, advised the public not to worry about the increase in the number of positive cases detected at the detention depots, as the premises were in isolated areas and under surveillance by the authorities.    \u201cThe ministry will continue to cooperate with the Immigration Department, the police and other government agencies to manage the cases involving detention depots.    \u201cFor example, (we conduct) investigation, close contact tracing, risk assessment by relevant agencies, active screening for symptoms and samples for case detection and education.    \u201cThe positive cases are isolated and treated at hospitals; and close contacts are placed under observation and surveillance,\u201d he said.

Tenaganita executive director Glorene Das believes that no priority was given to testing, screening and social distancing in the Immigration depots.    Glorene said Tenaganita stood by its earlier statement that called for the immediate repatriation and release of those detained at the detention centres.    \u201cThe government must immediately halt the ongoing arrests of undocumented migrants, refugees, asylum seekers and stateless persons. The Health Ministry must work with the Immigration Department and Home Ministry to handle the current situation,\u201d she said, adding that independent bodies such as civil society groups should be allowed to have monitoring visits.    Human rights group North-South Initiative (NSI) director Adrian Pereira claimed that detention centres in Malaysia had for years been \u201cnotorious\u201d for overcrowding and poor healthcare.    Pereira said alternatives to detention centres should be used, especially during high-risk times like now.    On Facebook, Health director-general Datuk Dr Noor Hisham Abdullah said as the virus spread at these centres, the authorities needed to enhance active case detection, and immediately isolate and treat positive cases.    \u201cQuarantine those close contacts and decontaminate the respective centres. The virus knows no boundaries and does not favour any ethnicity and social status.    \u201cOur whole government and whole community approach should work together to fight the virus. Negative sentiments against detainees must not be amplified and must not be a catalyst for discrimination in saving lives,\u201d he said.    Federation of Chinese Associations Malaysia (Huazong) said testing and contact tracing in relation to migrant workers should be ramped up.    Its president Tan Sri Goh Tian Chuan said this was important because migrant workers had been identified as a high-risk group, besides being the \u201chidden reservoir\u201d for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19.    \u201cThe government should review, improve and enhance the existing mechanism for Covid-19 testing of foreign workers, especially those in the construction sector,\u201d he said.    In a statement on Sunday, he said at the current rate of testing, it might take another six months to complete the testing of the estimated two million documented migrants workers, and this would seriously hamper the government\u2019s ongoing efforts to revive the economy. \n                \n                "},

For many of us who observe Ramadan, it is always our hope and desire that we are able to observe this special month in the Islamic calendar as meaningfully as possible and that our good deeds are accepted and our sins forgiven. Ramadan was of course not just a time for fasting but also a time for sacrifice, which we saw plenty of from many of my colleagues and other frontliners who stepped up to be a part of the nation\u2019s Covid-19 response whether directly or indirectly.    It made me especially proud to belong to the public health sector as everybody rallied and worked tirelessly to ensure that we provided the best and safest care to all of our patients while ensuring that we remained safe ourselves. The spectre of getting infected ourselves was real, as we learned of the thousands of healthcare workers who had become infected with Covid-19 and the hundreds who have died from it around the world. But for most of us this is our duty, this was what we had signed up to when we gained the right to call ourselves \u201cdoctor\u201d.    Without a doubt we can be proud of Malaysia\u2019s timely actions and achievements in the country\u2019s response to the Covid-19 threat. Health director-general Datuk Dr Noor Hisham Abdullah and his entire team deserve all the accolades they have received for keeping the level of infection under control, albeit at not an inconsiderable cost.    Despite the intense international effort in search of an effective vaccine, it will still be at least a good 18 months away before any comes into wide use. Given that the pandemic is not going to be going away anytime soon, for us frontliners the challenge will be to maintain these high standards of care and service delivery while adhering to physical distancing and infection control procedures in the long foreseeable future.    Ramadan was also a time for self-reflection, a time and opportunity to reflect on what the pandemic has meant to us as individuals and what it means to our society as a whole. Beyond the inconvenience of the movement control order (MCO) and the fear and anxiety of getting infected, I am sure Covid-19 has meant different things to different people. It has certainly taught me a lot of lessons and made me reflect deeply on what is important and what matters less so. It is a humbling experience to live through this pandemic and see how a 125nm particle has brought the whole world to its knees. From the original epicentre in Wuhan, China, to the wealthy Italian region of Lombardy to bustling New York City, no country has been spared as these little particles found their way across the world and infected more than five million people and killed over 300 000 people in just five short months. The tragedy of this pandemic will one day not only be counted in the number infected and the lives lost but also in how quickly and effectively governments and leaders responded as the epidemic unfolded.    Much has been said about the Covid-19 pandemic bringing to the fore inequalities and divisions in society. It is encouraging that the previously deafening, divisive racial rhetoric in our country has been somewhat muted throughout this epidemic \u2013 though, unfortunately, that has been replaced by the demonisation of foreign workers and undocumented immigrants. Just like the HIV epidemic before it, the Covid-19 pandemic hits especially hard those already vulnerable and marginalised by society. While some of us moan about MCO period restrictions, to many there MCO has meant a loss of income and, to some, even a loss of basic dignity. \u201cWe may be in the same storm, but not all of us are in the same boat\u201d is a saying that vividly captures the inequality that has deepened through this crisis.    We still have many more months of the pandemic to live through and the report card is still out. At this stage we seem to have passed the epidemic control test but as we move forward, the question is will we pass the bigger test? Will we take stock and learn from the devastation of Covid-19 and move towards a more compassionate, mutually respectful, inclusive, equal and just society? Will we continue to close a blind eye to the destruction of the environment in the name of profit and greed? Will we permit science and evidence to inform and guide our policies or will we continue to allow ideology and self-interest to rule?    As a woman of science I try and keep pace with the unprecedented speed and volume of the scientific knowledge on SARS-CoV-2 and use it to inform and improve patient care as well as public health policies. As a woman of faith, I cannot help but feel that Allah swt has unleashed these 125nm particles upon us to make us stop, reflect, learn and find ways in which we can make ourselves and this world a better place, for ourselves and the people we will one day leave it to, our children and their children after them. As a Muslim, there could not have been a better time to do so than the Ramadan just passed.
