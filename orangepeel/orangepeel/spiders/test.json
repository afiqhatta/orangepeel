Rahmad said diplomatic channels would be used to report the migrants in view of the fact that other countries were also controlling entries due to the pandemic.    \"There are no Covid-19 positive cases at the Immigration detention centre here,\" he added.    On Tuesday (May 26), Senior Minister Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri Yaakob said the government would deport undocumented migrants who were free of Covid-19 back to their own countries. \n                \n                "},

South Korea\u2019s Centre for Disease Control and Prevention on Tuesday (May 26) also reported two more deaths, bringing national totals to 11,225 and 269 fatalities. Officials linked three of the new cases to international arrivals. South Korea has been reporting around 20 new cases per day over the past two weeks after health workers found hundreds of infections linked to clubgoers who went out in early May as the country eased on social distancing. The caseload has slowed from early March when it was reporting hundreds of new cases a day, but the new infections in the greater capital area has caused concern as authorities proceed with a phased reopening of schools, which began with high school seniors last week. Around 2.4 million high school juniors, middle school seniors, first- and second-grade elementary school children and kindergartners will be returning to school on Wednesday. Health Minister Park Neung-hoo during a virus meeting urged school officials to double-check their preventive measures. He called for authorities to strengthen monitoring on some 390,000 undocumented foreign nationals who may have poor access to medical services and tests, but related measures weren\u2019t immediately announced. South Korea also Tuesday began requiring people to wear masks on public transit and while using taxis. People in South Korea, like in much of Asia, have generally worn masks in public settings and no major disruptions were reported. Health authorities have left mask enforcement to bus drivers and subway station workers. Taxi drivers are allowed to refuse picking up passengers if they aren\u2019t wearing masks. South Korea since March has banned the exports of masks and channelled most domestically produced masks to pharmacies, where people are currently limited to buying three masks per week. The nationwide rationing was a drastic attempt at calming public anger over shortages, but supply has stabilised. - AP\n                \n                "},

On March 22, Ismail Sabri gave an assurance that the government had agreed not to look into the legal status of foreigners or take action against them for being in the country without legal status during the Covid-19 screening.

He added that 1,972 Malaysians had returned to the country, bringing the total number of those returning home from abroad to 46,859 since April 3.    Of this, he said that 36,128 Malaysians who had returned from abroad were allowed to go home after undergoing mandatory 14-days quarantine.    On a separate matter, Ismail Sabri warned state football associations not to approve the resumption of matches if the current conditional movement control order (MCO) ends on June 9.    He said discussions are being held with the Football Association of Malaysia (FAM) and the Health Ministry to determine the measures if and when the local football league is to restart again.    However, he said the respective state football associations could draft up their own standard operating procedures (SOPs) in the meantime while waiting for a final decision from the government.

He said the first phase of the deportation process involved 2,761 Indonesians.    The first batch of 450 Indonesian migrants was deported on Saturday (June 6) onboard three flights to Jakarta, Medan and Surabaya. The second batch of 445 migrants would be deported on June 10.    On June 22, a total of 1,294 migrants would be deported onboard boats to Medan.    He said the second phase involving 2,623 Indonesians would be deported in two months.    Malaysia had also secured co-operation from the Chinese Embassy to deport more than 500 of its citizens, he said.    He added that 675 migrants were currently undergoing treatment after testing positive for Covid-19.    \"Those discharged after treatment will subsequently be deported,\" he said.    Ismail also expressed concerns over continuous attempt to cross the Malaysian border via \"rat\" lanes, as well as the high number of Covid-19 cases involving undocumented migrants.    Ops Benteng, involving the army, police, the Malaysian Maritime Enforcement Agency and Malaysian Border Security Agency, will be strictly enforced to block their entry, he said.    \"From May 1 to Friday (June 5), 393 undocumented migrants and 72 tekong had been detained,\" he said.

Shoplots, roadside stalls and outlets operating inside complexes were also raided by Kuala Lumpur City Hall (DBKL) enforcement officers and sealed with yellow tape as a warning to those who break the law.    Kuala Lumpur mayor Datuk Nor Hisham Ahmad Dahlan said the blitz was carried out following enforcement officers\u2019 investigation as well as tip-off from business owners and the public.    He said dozens of foreigners were undocumented and were operating using expired or illegal work permits or using licence that was sublet to them by Malaysians.    The businesses range from restaurants, sundry shops, fruit and vegetable stalls to tailoring business, car wash and telephone accessories shops.    It was learnt that residents raised concerns about the illegal businesses that were contributing to pollution and overcrowding in various locations across Kuala Lumpur.    In some places, even residential apartments were being used as a \u201cwet market\u201d and storage space for food.    Enforcement was carried out under Section 101 of the Local Government Act 1976 and Section 70 of the Street and Drainage Act 1974.

The Deputy Tourism, Arts and Culture Minister said this forum was aimed at engaging stakeholders and the public to gather feedback and find solutions to resolve the problem of illegal immigrants, particularly in Sabah.    \u201cThe Covid-19 pandemic has in a way created an unprecedented opportunity in highlighting the presence of the millions of illegal and unlawful foreigners in Malaysia,\u201d Jeffrey said in a statement here on Tuesday (May 26).    He cited as examples various news reports over the arrests of illegal immigrants in Sabah as well as reports of attempted entry by Rohingya in Langkawi and north-western Peninsular Malaysia.    Jeffrey said illegal immigrants and undocumented foreigners in Malaysia had been receiving much media coverage and causing social media anger from netizens recently.    \u201cThese foreigners and illegals pose a huge threat, not just because of the Covid-19 infections and social problems. A long-term sustainable solution needs to be put in place,\u201d Jeffrey said.    He said the time has come for concerted efforts by all stakeholders and connected parties to sit down and work out a holistic long-term plan to deal with illegal immigrants and undocumented persons in Malaysia.    He said he has nothing against legal foreigners entering Sabah via proper means, but not through backdoor routes.    \u201cBy all means, they are welcome in Malaysia - but it must be through the proper immigration channels with proper documentation from their home countries,\u201d Jeffrey said.

For many of us who observe Ramadan, it is always our hope and desire that we are able to observe this special month in the Islamic calendar as meaningfully as possible and that our good deeds are accepted and our sins forgiven. Ramadan was of course not just a time for fasting but also a time for sacrifice, which we saw plenty of from many of my colleagues and other frontliners who stepped up to be a part of the nation\u2019s Covid-19 response whether directly or indirectly.    It made me especially proud to belong to the public health sector as everybody rallied and worked tirelessly to ensure that we provided the best and safest care to all of our patients while ensuring that we remained safe ourselves. The spectre of getting infected ourselves was real, as we learned of the thousands of healthcare workers who had become infected with Covid-19 and the hundreds who have died from it around the world. But for most of us this is our duty, this was what we had signed up to when we gained the right to call ourselves \u201cdoctor\u201d.    Without a doubt we can be proud of Malaysia\u2019s timely actions and achievements in the country\u2019s response to the Covid-19 threat. Health director-general Datuk Dr Noor Hisham Abdullah and his entire team deserve all the accolades they have received for keeping the level of infection under control, albeit at not an inconsiderable cost.    Despite the intense international effort in search of an effective vaccine, it will still be at least a good 18 months away before any comes into wide use. Given that the pandemic is not going to be going away anytime soon, for us frontliners the challenge will be to maintain these high standards of care and service delivery while adhering to physical distancing and infection control procedures in the long foreseeable future.    Ramadan was also a time for self-reflection, a time and opportunity to reflect on what the pandemic has meant to us as individuals and what it means to our society as a whole. Beyond the inconvenience of the movement control order (MCO) and the fear and anxiety of getting infected, I am sure Covid-19 has meant different things to different people. It has certainly taught me a lot of lessons and made me reflect deeply on what is important and what matters less so. It is a humbling experience to live through this pandemic and see how a 125nm particle has brought the whole world to its knees. From the original epicentre in Wuhan, China, to the wealthy Italian region of Lombardy to bustling New York City, no country has been spared as these little particles found their way across the world and infected more than five million people and killed over 300 000 people in just five short months. The tragedy of this pandemic will one day not only be counted in the number infected and the lives lost but also in how quickly and effectively governments and leaders responded as the epidemic unfolded.    Much has been said about the Covid-19 pandemic bringing to the fore inequalities and divisions in society. It is encouraging that the previously deafening, divisive racial rhetoric in our country has been somewhat muted throughout this epidemic \u2013 though, unfortunately, that has been replaced by the demonisation of foreign workers and undocumented immigrants. Just like the HIV epidemic before it, the Covid-19 pandemic hits especially hard those already vulnerable and marginalised by society. While some of us moan about MCO period restrictions, to many there MCO has meant a loss of income and, to some, even a loss of basic dignity. \u201cWe may be in the same storm, but not all of us are in the same boat\u201d is a saying that vividly captures the inequality that has deepened through this crisis.    We still have many more months of the pandemic to live through and the report card is still out. At this stage we seem to have passed the epidemic control test but as we move forward, the question is will we pass the bigger test? Will we take stock and learn from the devastation of Covid-19 and move towards a more compassionate, mutually respectful, inclusive, equal and just society? Will we continue to close a blind eye to the destruction of the environment in the name of profit and greed? Will we permit science and evidence to inform and guide our policies or will we continue to allow ideology and self-interest to rule?    As a woman of science I try and keep pace with the unprecedented speed and volume of the scientific knowledge on SARS-CoV-2 and use it to inform and improve patient care as well as public health policies. As a woman of faith, I cannot help but feel that Allah swt has unleashed these 125nm particles upon us to make us stop, reflect, learn and find ways in which we can make ourselves and this world a better place, for ourselves and the people we will one day leave it to, our children and their children after them. As a Muslim, there could not have been a better time to do so than the Ramadan just passed.

At a press conference held on May 22, Senior Minister Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri Yaakob stated that the 60 confirmed positive cases in Bukit Jalil have been in the centre before the movement control order (MCO) took effect on March 18, and that all 114 of the Immigration officers on duty have tested negative.    While the government has stated that it will be screening detainees, testing alone is not a foolproof measure of preventing the spread of the virus. If the testing is only done once, there is no guarantee that the person would be free from infection, as the infected person may test negative because the test is unable to detect new exposure to infection within five days.    We are aware that three weeks are sufficient to trigger two to three generations of the spread of the virus. Given the pre-existing cramped conditions in the centres and the pressure that will be placed on the infrastructure with more detainees being brought in, we have grave concerns regarding the government\u2019s ability to prevent the transmission of disease.    Contrary to prevailing logic, the government\u2019s punitive approach toward undocumented migrant workers and refugees during this time of crisis poses a public health risk \u2013 for example, some individuals attempted escape from enhanced MCO areas. It also hurts the local economy as many sectors do rely on such workers for their day-to-day operations. It further puts Immigration officers at grave risk of contracting the disease and transmitting it to their family members.    Regrettably, the arrests of undocumented migrant workers by the government at this time has also had another inadvertent impact: It has made immigrant communities distrustful of the health system. This erodes the tremendous efforts made by the Health Ministry to combat this pandemic.    Civil society groups worked hard to be the bridge between immigrant communities and the government to build trust in the health system, which is critical to controlling this outbreak. Upon assurances from the Health Ministry in the early days of the pandemic, they encouraged immigrant and refugee communities to come out for Covid-19 screening voluntarily and without fear. Although non-citizens and the trust they place in a country\u2019s health system may not appear to be a matter of importance from a legal point of view, it is critical from a public health perspective in arresting the spread of disease. Non-health-related ministries need to understand the importance of respecting public health principles while we are in the midst of an outbreak of a disease that has no proven treatment, and that relies critically on prevention of disease transmission to stop spreading.    In this connection, the government must remember that as a member of the global community, the United Nations and the World Health Organisation, it has a higher duty of care towards incarcerated people as well as an obligation to control the spread of the pandemic regionally and globally. The detection of Covid-19 in deported immigrants, as in the case of the immigrants from Myanmar, does not augur well for Malaysia\u2019s international reputation. This is the time for nations to show solidarity and support for battling what is a global pandemic.    Finally, it cannot be over-emphasised that taking care and monitoring the health of large immigrant communities in the country is a way to also protect co-existing local communities.    As such we urgently call upon the government to:    >  Immediately stop the arrests of undocumented immigrants, refugees and asylum seekers as well as stateless persons without documents.    >  Allow the Health Ministry to take the lead in efforts to control the spread of Covid-19, including among non-citizens, and support the ministry in its efforts to combat the pandemic.    >  Invite Suhakam (the Human Rights Commission of Malaysia) to undertake a monitoring visit to detention centres to provide an independent report of the events leading to the detection of Covid-19 cases in them, and to ensure that strong preventive measures are being taken to control disease transmission in the centres.    >  Cooperate with international agencies and civil society organisations to increase detainees\u2019 access to hygiene products and other necessary supplies and to allow the UN High Commission on Refugees to identify and register Persons of Concern.    >  Develop a coherent and rational migration policy framework that links with an effective blueprint of the country\u2019s human resources needs.    >  Preserve the rule of law by taking action against xenophobic hate speech against immigrant communities whose contributions over the years have built this country.

The Malaysian authorities have swept up hundreds of undocumented workers in raids amid its movement control order, while its neighbour Indonesia, home to most of them, is repatriating its citizens. Just as Singapore has struggled to deal with a coronavirus outbreak that spread quickly through its population of foreign workers in dormitories, countries with large numbers of low-wage migrant workers are grappling with similar issues. From Asia to the Middle East, the Covid-19 (coronavirus) pandemic is exposing the unique vulnerabilities of the world's estimated 164 million low-paid migrant workers, who toil at the jobs locals do not want, to save money and get a leg up back home. While some appear to have escaped the same sort of outbreak Singapore is dealing with, activists say good examples of how to manage this segment of their population are few and far between. As Covid-19 takes its toll on economies and public health in many countries, low-wage migrant worker populations have largely been affected disproportionately. Observers say problems include poor living conditions, insufficient legal protection and limited access to healthcare. Last month, Saudi Arabia had shipped home nearly 3,000 of the estimated 200,000 Ethiopians living there before the United Nations called for a halt. In Kuwait last month, at least a dozen migrant workers took their own lives or attempted to, according to migrant-rights.org, an activist website, citing media reports. In Thailand, hundreds of thousands of workers from neighbouring countries like Myanmar, Laos and Cambodia are said to have fled home after a lockdown left them with the prospect of being stuck without money or food. n Malaysia, police rounded up 200 undocumented workers last week alone in Petaling Jaya, outside Kuala Lumpur, even as officials gradually ease movement restrictions. The country is thought to have at least five million migrant workers. Indonesia, one of the world's biggest contributors of labour, has repatriated more than 130,000 of its citizens working abroad as construction workers, cruise ship staff and housekeepers, as well as students. David Welsh, country director of the South-East Asia branch of the Solidarity Centre, a non-profit organisation aligned with the United States-based labour federation AFL-CIO, said the crisis has exposed the poor conditions many migrant workers face. \"Migrant workers have been left aside by governments who have relied on them to do dangerous jobs that have become even more dangerous during this crisis,\" Welsh said. Then, there is Qatar, where observers say criticism of the country's treatment of migrant labour in the wake of its successful bid to host the Fifa World Cup in 2022 has sparked changes that are a lesson to others but also a demonstration of how difficult the process is going to be. Like in Singapore, the outbreak in Qatar has centred on its foreign workers, who outnumber Qataris in the workforce by nearly 20 to one. Total infections have ticked past 40,000 in a country with 2.8 million people. Last October, it abolished exit visas for departing workers and did away with discriminatory laws assigning minimum wages by nationality. The monarchy at the same time abolished the sponsorship rules that tie workers to jobs and make them vulnerable to abuse. The country's new minimum wage laws also override bilateral agreements with countries of origin that can see a Bangladeshi welder, for example, earning two-thirds what a Filipino might. Qatar's ambition to host the World Cup has helped prompt the changes. Shortly after securing the event a decade ago, Qatar publicly promised four weeks' paid leave, overtime and other benefits to workers employed by the contractors awarded work. Contractors erecting more than half a dozen stadiums and other needed infrastructure offer workers attractive terms that meet the scrutiny of activists and unions. Apolinar Tolentino, regional representative for the Building and Wood Workers' International Asia-Pacific, said his union has had regular access to inspect work sites and dormitories where workers are housed four to an air-conditioned room and bunk beds are banned. The visits included group interviews with workers to assess conditions including health and safety, food quality and even Internet speeds. \"Qatar is setting an example in the region of how to treat its migrant labour,\" said Tolentino. But he acknowledges that the improvement has not been even. Earlier this month, the government began easing a two-month lockdown of the sprawling Industrial Area outside of Doha, where hundreds of thousands of workers were holed up in dormitories. The government requires all employers to pay furloughed workers, but there have been reports of workers stranded and begging for food. The problem is fuelled in part by undocumented foreign workers relying on short-term casual work, who do not have regular employers. \"Compliance with standards outside the World Cup projects are more challenging,\" Tolentino said. \"There is almost no direct access by international organisations.\" Last month, Amnesty International and a coalition of non-governmental organisations and trade unions sent letters to Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Bahrain, Kuwait and Oman, raising concerns about migrant workers. Amnesty International's Middle East research director Lynn Maalouf said: \"While some governments made promising commitments to support migrant workers, much more needs to be done to ensure Covid-19 will not result in further human rights violations and greater suffering for migrant workers in these countries.\" - The Straits Times/Asian News Network\n                \n                "},

We acknowledge that we need them for dangerous, dirty and difficult (3D) jobs.    \u201cAs for those who entered the country illegally and do not have valid documents, we have to take action against them. Even then, we do it humanely. When we find that some of them are Covid-19 positive at our depots, we screen all of them -100% - so that they can be saved.    \u201cWe send them to MAEPS (Malaysia Agro Exposition Park Serdang) to be treated. If you check out MAEPS, it is such a nice place and the government has spent millions of ringgit to set it up (as a Covid-19 hospital).    \u201cIf we are worried about an increasing number of positive cases among them, there are two more places they can be placed at. So to call the government inhumane is not fair, \u201d he said.    Ismail Sabri added that the treatment does not change anything about their status.    \u201cThey entered the country illegally and do not have any right to be here. We are in talks with their home countries to take them back. We do not even want to jail them here, \u201d said Ismail Sabri at the National Security Council (MKN)\u2019s daily Covid-19 press conference here.    Ismail Sabri was asked about claims that the Malaysian government had not treated its foreign workers humanely during the Covid-19 pandemic.    On the rounding up of undocumented migrants during the enhanced movement control order (MCO), Ismail Sabri said it had to be done.    \u201cWhen the enhanced MCO is lifted and the barbed wires are removed, the residents of the area are free to move - including those who are undocumented. If we allow them to be free, then it is wrong because they are illegals.    \u201cWe are not taking advantage of them. We send them to our detention depots. If they test negative for Covid-19, we will deport them.    \u201cIt is not nice to accuse Malaysia of mistreatment. In fact, other countries treat them (undocumented migrants) worse. There is no need for politicians or NGOs to act as heroes for undocumented migrants, \u201d he said.    On the capacity of the temporary hospital in MAEPS, Ismail Sabri said it can accommodate 600 patients - with 230 beds in use so far.    \u201cBesides MAEPS, we also have the unused leprosy centre in the Sungai Buloh Hospital and the former maternity wards at the Kuala Lumpur Hospital, giving us a capacity of 1,430 beds, \u201d he said.    As of Tuesday, 382 positive cases were found among detainees at three Immigration Depots in Bukit Jalil, Semenyih and Sepang.      \n                \n                "},

The Senior Minister (Security) said the decision was made at a meeting on Tuesday (May 26) morning between the various ministries and departments involved including the Home Ministry.    He said they would get the assistance of the various embassies to deport the undocumented migrants.    \u201cThey will undergo screening before they are deported. Only those who are negative will be deported, \u201d he said during a daily press briefing on the Covid-19 situation on Tuesday.    He also said that anyone linked to the three Immigration detention depots in Bukit Jalil, Semenyih and Sepang would have to undergo a swab test.

Instead, Aegile Fernandez \u2013 who has 37 years of experience in immigration and human-trafficking issues \u2013 said the government should work with NGOs, civil society and employers to educate migrant workers about the pandemic.    \u201cIf the undocumented foreign workers are treated with kindness, they will seek treatment if they are ill, \u201d she said.    Early this week, most of the Covid-19 clusters were discovered at three immigration detention depots and centres (DTIs) in Sepang, Bukit Jalil and Semenyih.    Health director-general Datuk Dr Noor Hisham Abdullah said that of the 172 cases tested positive in the country on Monday, 112 were from the DTIs.    The next day, 173 foreigners tested positive. Thirteen were security guards from Cheras.    The spike in cases, three-digit figures since May 3, has the public concerned but Dr Noor Hisham assured everyone that the DTIs were in isolated areas and under control by local authorities.    On the same day, Senior Minister Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri Yaakob said the government would send DTI detainees to Covid-19 makeshift hospitals and deport those who were free of Covid-19.    Infectious disease consultant Datuk Dr Christopher Lee concurred with Aegile.    \u201cIf we feel they are a major risk group based on their close living conditions, then we need to engage them rather than make them hide from the authorities, \u201d he said.    Dr Lee also said that if the undocumented workers had acquired the infection inside the camps, then the authorities needed to sort out the hygiene and social distancing issues there although it would pose a challenge due to the huge numbers.    \u201cEthically, we still have to try our best to minimise the risks, \u201d he said.    Universiti Malaya senior research consultant academician Emeritus Prof Datuk Dr Lam Sai Kit also said the Immigration Department should not detain undocumented migrants at this stage to prevent overcrowding.    \u201cDetainees should be educated on how the virus is spread and about personal hygiene, including wearing of face masks, \u201d he said.    However, consultant public health physician Datuk Lokman Hakim Sulaiman agreed with the authorities that detaining undocumented workers would help minimise Covid-19\u2019s spread to the general public and those tested negative should be deported.    \u201cWho will foot their bill if all undocumented workers are required to be tested?\u201d he said. \n                \n                "},

The Senior Minister said the government has assigned three facilities to house patients from the immigration depot clusters, with a total capacity of about 1,430 beds.    The three places are the Malaysia Agro Exposition Park Serdang (MAEPS), Hospital Sungai Buloh\u2019s leprosy centre and the unused maternity ward at Hospital Kuala Lumpur.    \u201cWe are ready. So far, we only have 230 patients at MAEPS. MAEPS can accommodate 600 patients.    \u201cIn total, all three facilities can put up 1,430 patients. So even if there is an increase in cases, we have enough places, \u201d he said at the National Security Council\u2019s daily Covid-19 press briefing here.    Ismail Sabri also defended the government\u2019s treatment of undocumented migrants throughout the Covid-19 pandemic.    He said those without documents were of illegal status in the country no matter what, adding that it was the Immigration Department\u2019s duty to manage them.    \u201cNothing changes their status. They entered the country illegally and do not have any right to be here. We are in talks with their home countries to take them back. We do not even want to jail them here, \u201d he said.

On a related matter, Ismail Sabri, who is also Defence Minister, said 824 motorists that attempted interstate travel without permission on Tuesday were told to turn back - an increase from the 738 attempts recorded the day before.    He said the police has also detained 136 individuals, of which 75 were remanded while 61 were on bail for defying the conditional movement control order (MCO).    \u201cCompounds were also issued to 534 individuals for various offences under the conditional MCO, \u201d he said.    States that recorded the highest number of attempts to cross borders are Selangor (284), Kedah (122) and Melaka (113).    Ismail Sabri also said that audit firms that instructed their staff to work in different states were breaching the conditional MCO.    \u201cAs I have mentioned previously, interstate travels are only for emergencies such as a death or for close family members to visit those who are very ill.    \u201cAuditors wanting to check accounts of (their clients) is obviously not part of it.

The decision, he said, was made yesterday following a meeting between various departments along with the Home and Works ministries.    Ismail Sabri noted that the meeting was called after a huge number of detainees in three immigration centres were found to be Covid-19 positive.    He said the Foreign Ministry would seek the assistance of the various embassies on this issue.    Meanwhile, he said everyone linked to the three Immigration detention depots in Bukit Jalil, Semenyih and Sepang would also be tested.    They include staff of the centres, their families and even those who supply food to these centres, he added.

The workers\u2019 temperatures were taken and recorded every morning before they go to the worksite.    Meanwhile, state investment, industry and trade, small and medium industries committee chairman Datuk Teng Chang Khim said the Selangor government was helping the Health Ministry in its efforts to detect and curb Covid-19 infection among construction workers.    \u201cThe state cannot take the lead on this matter and thus we are doing everything possible to complement the initiatives taken by the ministry, \u2019\u2019 said Teng.    This included having a budget to go towards carrying out screening of construction workers and providing whatever else was required by the Health Ministry.    \u201cFor instance, if the ministry has insufficient personal protective gears, we will provide them with these, \u2019\u2019 said Teng, adding that the Health Ministry was doing the right thing to stem Covid-19 cases in the construction industry.    Teng said sending home undocumented workers who were Covid-19 negative as well as random testing was the only viable option at the moment.    Meanwhile, state health, welfare, women empowerment and family committee chairman Dr Siti Mariah Mahmud said RM2.06mil has been allocated by the Selangor government for screening of high risk groups.    \u201cWe\u2019ll be having a meeting with Mentri Besar Datuk Seri Amirudin Shari, the state health department as well as Selangor Task Force for Covid-19 on June 1 to determine all the high risk groups for screening, \u2019\u2019 said Dr Siti Mariah.    She added that PPEs were also being produced by the state\u2019s Women Development Centre in collaboration with Hospital Banting.    In Sabah, things are rough. Many construction sites are not running due to employers\u2019 inability to get their workers tested for Covid-19.    Sabah Builders Association (SBA) president Lou Chi Nam said that feedback from SBA\u2019s 100-odd members was that most of them would not begin work until June \u2013 and if the conditional MCO were to be over.\u201cOne of the requirements to start operating is that these workers must have gotten tested for the virus and results obtained, \u201d he said. \u201cBut since many are not able to, mainly due to the cost, they cannot operate, \u201d he said.    Lou said those who could afford to pay for their workers\u2019 swab tests also had to wait for a long period as there was a limit to the number of tests health officials could conduct in a day. \n                \n                "},

Federation of Malaysian Manufacturers (FMM) president Tan Sri Soh Thian Lai said the amendments to the Minimum Standards of Housing and Amenities (Amendment) Act was a good decision in the long term as it would ensure conducive housing condition for all workers, and enhance the health and productivity of the workforce in the country.    However, Soh said the amendments, which would come into force on June 1 in Peninsular Malaysia and the Federal Territory of Labuan, could pose some challenges to fulfilling them.    The Human Resources Ministry said the government would give a three-month grace period until Aug 31 to give room for employers to make the necessary arrangements.    The enforcement under the Act will begin on Sept 1. The amendments to the Act was passed in Parliament last July and was gazetted on Sept 18.    \u201cBut with the huge number of foreign workers in Malaysia, around two million documented and about four million undocumented, it could pose a big challenge to fulfil conditions under the amendments of the Act within 15 months, including the three-month grace period as all affected employers who employ foreign workers must comply with it, \u201d said Soh.    \u201cNow that the highest risk clusters of Covid-19 infections are foreign workers, this Act is timely \u2013 but it\u2019s too short a time to get the employers prepared.    \u201cWe urge the authorities to give more time, at least six months, for companies to reset and rearrange according to the standard operating procedure (SOP), \u201d Soh said.    Soh said the government should now focus on the construction sites and quarters of foreign workers in the yellow and red zones as they were the high-risk clusters.    \u201cThe most important thing is for all companies with foreign workers to follow the SOP set by the Health Ministry and authorities to minimise the risks, \u201d he said.    Master Builders Association of Malaysia (MBAM) president Foo Chek Lee said it was in full support of the implementation of the amendment, which it helped to draft years ago.    \u201cA worker needs a good place to stay and rest.    \u201cIf they don\u2019t have proper rest, they can\u2019t work and if their living condition is not good, they will get sick and it affects productivity, \u201d he said.    Foo said big construction companies would not have problems to provide housing according to the guidelines.    He pointed out that some workers, however, were labourers who did not have permanent employment and chose to live in cramped conditions to save money.    \u201cThe main contractor and project owners are liable to provide proper accommodation to foreign workers.    \u201cHowever, some sub-contractors may still resort to providing housing in the form of kongsi or hostel but now they would have to follow the guidelines under the amendments, \u201d he said.    Foo, however, said the grace period was tight as it did not give much time for companies to prepare.    \u201cBut this is an extraordinary time with Covid-19, so companies will have to push and make it happen to safeguard public health, \u201d Foo added.    Real Estate and Housing Developers Association (Rehda) national council member Tony Khoo Boon Chuan said there was confusion on the ground as the detailed SOP was not available.    When asked on the ramification of the amendments, Khoo said the extra cost from providing housing, according to guidelines, would be transferred to home buyers eventually.    \u201cThis will result in more expensive houses and properties, \u201d he said.    Bina Puri Holdings group executive director Matthew Tee said although the amendments came at a cost, the industry would have to manage it.    \u201cWe try to follow the guidelines but all these implementations come at a cost, at a time when the construction sector is undergoing a recession, \u201d said Tee. \n                \n                "},

Its executive director Datuk Shamsuddin Bardan said the government\u2019s decision to enforce the amendment to the Workers\u2019 Minimum Standards of Housing and Amenities Act on June 1 was insensitive and did not take into account the problems faced by employers.    \u201cInstead, the government should assist employers by guiding them and workers on how Covid-19 can be prevented at their quarters.\u201d    The amendment will now include workers from all industries, including construction, with a three-month grace period granted to employers to implement it.    Shamsuddin said the minimum space requirement per worker living in a permanent dwelling is 4.8sq m while temporary dwelling is 3sq m.    \u201cThe space required for individual employees is demanding and costly and yet the maximum allowable charge on accommodation currently is only RM50 per worker, way below the centralised housing cost of RM100 to RM150 at market rate.    \u201cSome employers may have to send home some foreign workers because they don\u2019t have enough financial resources to comply with it,\u201d he said, adding that the government should target undocumented workers in which most Covid-19 cases were detected.    He also said that the grace period was too short as they were trying to cope with the requirements under the conditional movement control order to revive businesses.    Shamsuddin said providing \u201ckongsi\u201d type accommodation at construction sites would no longer be feasible under the new law.    \u201cAccommodation will be further away from construction sites and there is a need to provide transportation, which adds cost and travel time,\u201d he said.    However, Malaysian Medical Association president Dr N. Ganabaskaran welcomed the government\u2019s move, saying that workers should not be living in cramped rooms and a limit must be set on the number of workers per room.    \u201cPhysical distancing and good personal hygiene must be observed. Their accommodation must also be kept clean and disinfected,\u201d he said.    Dr Ganabaskaran said employers should also appoint team leaders to ensure preventive measures were enforced as part of the standard operating procedure (SOP).    \u201cRegular checks at construction sites and foreign workers\u2019 accommodation should be conducted by the authorities,\u201d he said, adding that fines should be issued for non-compliance.    He also said sharing of food and drinks among the workers should not be allowed. \n                \n                "},

{"title": "\n            Appropriate living conditions are essential for the migrant workers\n        ", "region": "Letters\n                        ", "date": 0, "text": "\n                 \n                                                \n                 Malaysians recently have been worried by news of a spike in Covid-19 infections among foreign workers. The situation is similar to what happened in Singapore with the number of local cases going down and a spike in new cases appearing among foreign workers. Clusters of Covid-19 infections have been detected at three construction sites and three immigration depots. More than 4,000 undocumented immigrants have been detained at these depots for not possessing valid travel and work documents. As the number of cases have increased, some have started to blame foreign workers for the spread of the disease \u2013 but is it justifiable to do so?    Let us first look at the factors that work against efforts to mitigate the spread of the virus. According to the Health director-general Datuk Dr Noor Hisham Abdullah, the main factors are the workers\u2019 crowded living environment and poor hygiene practices. But migrant workers should not be the only ones blamed for such conditions. Aside from probably being uneducated about hygiene, it is very likely that the workers have no choice about living in crowded conditions because that is all they can afford on their low wages or because those are the accommodations that they have been provided by their employers.    Employers who are responsible for this should also bear some of the responsibility. The implementation of standard operating procedures (SOPs) to mitigate the spread of Covid-19 should not only be limited to worksites.    Dr Noor Hisham has called on employers to ensure that physical distancing measures at workers\u2019 accommodations are taken seriously by having beds at least 1m to 2m apart, enough space so they can avoid preparing and consuming food in large groups, and ensuring that toilets and surrounding areas are clean and sanitised.    As stated in the Workers\u2019 Minimum Standards of Housing and Amenities Act (Amended 2019) \u2013 scheduled to have taken effect on June 1, 2020, in Peninsular Malaysia and Labuan \u2013 one of the duties and responsibilities of an employer associated with the current situation is laid out under Section 24J: (f) To take preventive measures to contain the spread of infectious diseases as ordered by the Medical Officer of Health in accordance with relevant written laws, the employer shall, at his own expense, make arrangements as ordered by the Medical Officer of Health so that all or any of the employees be given immunisation against any infectious disease. Another sub-section of Section 24J that is closely related is (b) to take necessary preventive measures to ensure employees\u2019 safety and well-being. So it is actually written into law that it is the employers\u2019 obligation to take action to curb the spread of Covid-19 among their foreign workers.    The right action has been pursued by making it compulsory for foreign workers in all sectors to undergo Covid-19 screening after the rise in the number of cases at construction sites. But the screening has to go along with preventive measures that ensure the workers have appropriate accommodations where they can maintain physical distancing.    On May 28, 2020, Human Resources Minister Datuk Seri M. Saravanan announced that the government is giving employers a grace period of three months, until Aug 31, to comply with the amendments to the Workers\u2019 Minimum Standards of Housing and Amenities Act. However, the deadly nature of the pandemic that could worsen current conditions quickly should be the key reason for employers to not delay complying with the Act. The amendments were passed in Parliament in July 2019, then gazetted in September 2019, so the duration since then should have provided sufficient time for employers. Delaying compliance would be irresponsible, as the spread of Covid-19 places Malaysian citizens at risk along with foreign workers.    Furthermore, as most of the foreign workers are hired for \u201c3D jobs\u201d (dangerous, dirty and difficult), they are accustomed to and accepting of unhygienic surroundings. So awareness about the severity of the pandemic and the need for hygiene to stop the spread of the virus needs to be instilled by educating them on SOPs at worksites and their accommodations.    Although we hope this spike of Covid-19 cases in Malaysia will not be as bad as Singapore\u2019s, as noted by Universiti Malaya public health specialist Dr Rafdzah Ahmad Zaki, prompt measures must be taken because foreign workers make up 15% to 30% of Malaysia\u2019s labour force. Singapore should be a wake-up call for Malaysia, and we can learn lessons from the experience there. The enforcement of the amended Act should not be delayed as it is not only important to prevent the virus spreading widely but also for the well-being of the workers.

Malaysian Employers Federation (MEF) executive director Datuk Shamsuddin Bardan said only a small number of sectors had manpower issues for now due to strict government rules and its requirements for foreign workers. \u201cMost employers are dealing with an excess of workers now rather than a shortage following a sharp decline in the global economy due to Covid-19. \u201cThe areas where the authorities are very strict about when it comes to foreign workers are, for example, some of the wet markets and construction industry, where crackdowns have been instituted,\u201d said Shamsuddin. \u201cThe shortage of foreign workers is only limited to certain sectors, namely construction, plantation and some manufacturing sectors.\u201d He said some manufacturers might still require foreign workers, especially those producing high-demand products, such as personal protective equipment. Shamsuddin said it had been hard for the plantation sector to attract locals due to the mistaken belief that jobs in the plantation are low-class. \u201cBut if we look deeper, plantation workers are provided with proper and furnished housing, land to cultivate in, good facilities and depending on one\u2019s effort to work \u2013 only that they live away from towns and cities,\u201d he said. \u201cA worker doing harvesting work can earn more than RM2,000 a month with most of his needs provided for free but Malaysians are not interested.\u201d Shamsuddin said society needed to change their views of less-favourable jobs, such as those deemed 3D \u2013 dirty, dangerous and difficult. He said such jobs could be \u201crebranded\u201d to attract more Malaysian workers. \u201cWe need to modernise these jobs and make them more attractive. \u201cFor example, in Switzerland, only a licensed plumber can legally carry out any work on the plumbing system in a home,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is about upgrading the profession itself so that it is not seen as less attractive jobs.\u201d He said the government should upgrade the skills required for those who want to work in such sectors, which could mean more investment in training, reskilling and upskilling of existing workers. Shamsuddin noted that Malaysia had enough foreign workers for the time being, and only some of them were in the \u201cwrong sector\u201d that was less in demand now. \u201cThe government should facilitate employers to temporarily redeploy these foreign workers, place them at sectors where they are needed without having to retrench and repatriate them,\u201d he said, adding that retrenching and repatriating were rather simplistic and not helping employers to reduce cost in reviving the economy post-Covid-19. Meanwhile, Indonesia has temporarily stopped sending its domestic workers to Malaysia after the MCO was enforced here, said the embassy\u2019s Information, Social and Cultural Affairs counsellor Agung Cahaya Sumirat. \u201cIn tackling the pandemic, the Indonesian government has temporarily halted sending migrants abroad. \u201cWe will see and evaluate the matter later while considering the development of the virus outbreak,\u201d he said in an interview. Malaysia is one of the main destinations for Indonesian migrant workers. According to the embassy\u2019s official data, there are almost 800,000 Indonesian migrants registered in Malaysia. However, it is learnt that the total number including undocumented workers could be three times more than the registered number. \n                \n                "},

Malaysia\u2019s economy relies on palm oil, its most important agricultural commodity, but palm oil needs migrant workers from Indonesia, Bangladesh and India to do jobs locals won\u2019t. As countries in South-East Asia struggle to get the Covid-19 outbreak under control, governments have tightened restrictions on travel for workers both coming and going. \"In the past, when people left, people also came,\u201d said Nageeb Wahab, chief executive at the Malaysian Palm Oil Association, a growers\u2019 group that represents 40% of palm plantations by area. \"Now, the coming is nil, and the leaving may be more after Malaysia\u2019s movement control order.\u201d Though environmental activists have pushed to rein in the palm industry for years, the labor shortage there signals the disruption unfolding at companies and farms around the world that depend on migrant workers. More than 70% of the country\u2019s plantation workers come from outside Malaysia\u2019s borders, according to an estimate by Rabobank; the country produces about 26% of the world\u2019s most common cooking oil. Production was already expected to drop by as much as 10% due to last year\u2019s dry weather and less aggressive fertilization. Now the labor shortage suggests the shortfall could more than double, Nageeb said, and growers are beginning to fidget. In April, top producer United Plantations Bhd. warned investors of a potential threat to production in the second half of 2020 \"as the present lockdown policy and restrictions on travel in many South East Asian countries will prevent guest workers from Indonesia, Bangladesh or India from seeking job opportunities in the Malaysian plantation industry.\u201d \u201dWe are indeed caught between a rock and a hard place as the first priority is of course to strictly adhere to the governments directives to keep Malaysia safe and Covid-19-free,\u201d Chief Executive Director Carl Bek-Nielsen said by email. That would mean the recruitment process to hire guest workers probably can\u2019t resume for the rest of the year, which would \"aggravate and exacerbate an already perilous situation for many plantation companies.\u201d Labor Squeeze Labor shortages have plagued growers for years, though never this acutely. Malaysia\u2019s plantations are now competing with higher wages offered by the growing industry in Indonesia, the world\u2019s biggest producer, and while benefits and employment practices vary, the industry has a reputation for exploitation and abuse. Automation has offered little relief. Palm fruit is fragile, growing in bunches that can weigh as much as 100 pounds, 60 feet off the ground. Most of it is still harvested by hand. Compared with soy or rapeseed, harvesting palm fruit requires 25 times more workers. The sudden and rapid outbreak of the coronavirus has turned long-term challenges into short-term ones, said Aurelia Britsch, head of commodities at Fitch Solutions. \"The sector is currently recording labor shortages, as ongoing lockdown measures mean palm oil estates are generally unable to recruit new foreign workers at a time when some employees have been repatriated to their origin countries due to the pandemic.\u201d In better times, the farmers might have raised wages to attract more workers. Not now, with global economies in free-fall and commodities prices growing more volatile. Even with a shortage of labor and, potentially, supply, the tropical oil on course for its biggest annual drop since 2012. \u201dThe reality is stark,\u201d United\u2019s Bek-Nielsen said. \"Growers are fearing that field losses will creep up from August-September towards the end of the year in tune with more and more guest workers returning home on leave. It is sadly a one-way traffic for the rest of 2020.\u201d Stopping production is an option for rubber and other crops, a way to use less labor and eat into stockpiles, forcing prices to rise. Palm isn\u2019t that flexible. \"It\u2019s not as simple as stopping production to let prices go up,\u201d said Nageeb. \"The moment you stop your production for two weeks, to bring it back to normal will take two months.\u201d Without enough workers to harvest the crop in a timely way, palm fruit will rot. The fruit that is harvested also has to be sent quickly to crushing mills or it\u2019ll start to oxidize, increasing acidity levels and reducing oil quality. Manual labor\u2019s also required to keep trees pruned and healthy for future seasons. Migrant Exodus For migrant workers, the virus outbreak and the lockdowns that followed have been been grueling. Those who left may not be able to return, losing a steady, if modest, source of income. Those that stayed faced other problems, said Glorene Das, executive director of Tenaganita, a Malaysian NGO that promotes rights of migrant workers and refugees. The government requires employers to provide workers with adequate social distance and protective gear, as well as routinely disinfected work environments. That applies to plantation operators too, but \"the remoteness of these locations and the lack of labor inspectors contribute to difficulty in enforcement,\u201d according to the International Labour Organization. During the lockdown, some plantation workers struggled to get enough food and other basic supplies. Documented and undocumented Indonesian workers are the biggest contingent among Malaysia\u2019s immigrant palm laborers. When the country imposed its nationwide lockdown, many workers on short-stay visas returned to Indonesia, said Zana Amir, program officer at Migrant Care, a Jakarta-headquartered group. \"They feared having no income in Malaysia, as the government conducted raids on illegal workers,\u201d Zana said.

The government will also launch next year the 12th Malaysia Plan (2021-2025), which will outline the medium and longer term policies for achieving our nation's development goals and provide the public sector expenditure programme to implement such policies.    In carrying out its development plans for economic and social progress, the government must place more focus on the human aspects of development to empower the people to face the challenges that lie ahead, such as a second round of the pandemic and the uncertainties arising from the geo-political tensions around the world.    We will have to increasingly rely on our own domestic strength to remain resilient against the adverse external developments. Hence, our development plans must place greater attention on improving the quality of the education and training system to create the internal capacity for growth and prosperity. They should equip school leavers and graduates with a stronger foundation to learn new skills.    Employers prefer to recruit job applicants who are trainable to raise their productivity and technical skills. New entrants to the labour market who are good in Maths, Science and English and who impress employers with their confident personality will find it easier to get the better paid jobs.    Those whose parents can afford to send their children for private tuition in Maths, Science, languages, music and art tend to have the advantage in having these superior qualities in them. There is a growing number of children who go to expensive private schools locally and abroad. These are the children of privileged families, political and corporate elites and the middle class.    This division of success in finding good jobs between income classes is not healthy for national unity. The national education system should therefore introduce reforms to provide the quality required in the employment market. Education should be free from racial, religious and communal politics to allow reforms to be successfully implemented so that all youths will have a level playing field in life.    In general, wage levels in Malaysia are low relative to its per capita GDP and standard of development. The main reason is the weak labour policies on employment and lack of controls on importing foreign workers. Irresponsible employers are taking advantage of undocumented workers, who out-number their legal counterparts, to suppress wage levels and ignore workers rights across all segments of the labour market. The culture of low wages spreads to all levels of employment, including executives. The result is that the share of wages in national income in Malaysia is low by international standards, thus indicating an imbalance in the distribution of the country\u2019s wealth between owners of capital and the working class.    Depressed wage levels explain much of the hardships among households living in the major urban centres. In addition, urban households struggle with the higher cost of living in cities compared to the rest of the country.    As our planners work on policies for the recovery of the economy and its long-term growth, they would prioritise projects that have a high impact on generating employment and income opportunities. This is to be expected as GDP growth is essential to lift up income levels.    At the same time, our planning agencies should also strengthen the education and labour policies to make them more dynamic in providing our working population with better wages and a higher share of the national income.    With higher levels of skills, the talent pool will be enhanced and facilitate Malaysia\u2019s efforts to attract more local and foreign investment into high technology and state-of-the-art industries, as the East Asian Tigers have done to restructure their economy and    become so advanced in their standards of living. They placed high priority on investing in their human resources to transform into high income countries within a short period of one generation.

For mother-of-two Aracely Mediavilla, the weekly deliveries of food and essential supplies from Barcelona-based volunteers have been a lifeline since she returned to Spain from Ecuador in the hope of getting her elder son medical treatment. \"It's not just a box of food - it's a box of love, of hope,\" said Mediavilla, fighting back tears. \"I am grateful for it because my children have been able to eat and feel loved.\" Mediavilla, 28, lived in Barcelona for years before Spain's 2008 economic crisis, and decided to return when her son Julian was diagnosed with retinopathy which blinded him in one eye. But the coronavirus lockdown, now in its 13th week, made it impossible for Mediavilla to get a job, and with a second newborn boy in tow, she and her mother Alicia rely on the help of a group of parishioners called Maria Auxiliadora, or Mary of Succour. The volunteers, who are associated to Santa Anna church in central Barcelona, gathered funds to provide Mediavilla's son Julian with special glasses. They also helped her land a job as an admnistrative assistant in a laboratory, which she began last week. On one sunny morning outside Santa Anna, the breakfast line stretched far down the street, with volunteers distributing reusable face masks to people as they queued for sacks of basic supplies and a cup of milky coffee. \"We do a breakfast, lunch and dinner service every day,\" said Peio Sanchez, priest at Santa Anna. \"This queue has been increasing, firstly because of the undocumented migrants.\" Undocumented immigrants are often precariously - and informally - employed, making them especially vulnerable to economic shocks and difficult domestic situations, Sanchez said. \"From the second month (we attended) people who had not received the corresponding aid and who no longer had the resources to pay for food and rent,\" Sanchez added. The priest expects Barcelona's homeless population - currently 1,500 - to triple in the next two years. Similar scenes have played out in Aluche, a poor neighbourhood in the capital Madrid. Spain's strict lockdown cost the economy 900,000 jobs in the second half of March alone. Last week, Spain approved an income support programme for about 2.5 million of its poorest citizens, set at about half the minimum wage of 1,108 euros $1,244.84) per month.

Afghanistan's foreign ministry said in a statement on Friday three Afghans were killed and four injured in Iran's central Yazd province after their vehicle was shot at by Iranian police, triggering the fire.  Video footage posted on social media showed a boy escaping from the blazing car with burns on parts of his body and begging for water. The ministry said the video was genuine and Afghans in Iran were trying to identify the victims. The boy's plea of \"give me some water, I am burning\" was widely circulated on social media and taken up by rights group demanding justice. \"Iran has no right to kill Afghan refugees, they can seal their borders, expel all Afghans but not kill them,\" said Ali Noori, a lawyer and rights activist said on Facebook. Afghans have for decades sought refuge in Iran from war and poverty in their homeland. Iran says about 2.5 million Afghan migrants, both legal and undocumented, live there. Facing its own economic problems worsened by international sanctions, Iran has at times tried to send Afghans home. Last month, Afghan officials said Iranian border guards killed 45 Afghan migrant workers by forcing them at gunpoint into a mountain torrent on the border. At the time, Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi issued a statement saying only that the incident in question had taken place on Afghan soil. Iranian embassy officials in Afghan capital, Kabul were not immediately available for comment on the latest incident.

Malaysia\u2019s economy relies on palm oil, its most important agricultural commodity, but palm oil needs migrant workers from Indonesia, Bangladesh and India to do jobs locals won\u2019t. As countries in South-East Asia struggle to get the Covid-19 outbreak under control, governments have tightened restrictions on travel for workers both coming and going. \"In the past, when people left, people also came,\u201d said Nageeb Wahab, chief executive at the Malaysian Palm Oil Association, a growers\u2019 group that represents 40% of palm plantations by area. \"Now, the coming is nil, and the leaving may be more after Malaysia\u2019s movement control order.\u201d Though environmental activists have pushed to rein in the palm industry for years, the labor shortage there signals the disruption unfolding at companies and farms around the world that depend on migrant workers. More than 70% of the country\u2019s plantation workers come from outside Malaysia\u2019s borders, according to an estimate by Rabobank; the country produces about 26% of the world\u2019s most common cooking oil. Production was already expected to drop by as much as 10% due to last year\u2019s dry weather and less aggressive fertilization. Now the labor shortage suggests the shortfall could more than double, Nageeb said, and growers are beginning to fidget. In April, top producer United Plantations Bhd. warned investors of a potential threat to production in the second half of 2020 \"as the present lockdown policy and restrictions on travel in many South East Asian countries will prevent guest workers from Indonesia, Bangladesh or India from seeking job opportunities in the Malaysian plantation industry.\u201d \u201dWe are indeed caught between a rock and a hard place as the first priority is of course to strictly adhere to the governments directives to keep Malaysia safe and Covid-19-free,\u201d Chief Executive Director Carl Bek-Nielsen said by email. That would mean the recruitment process to hire guest workers probably can\u2019t resume for the rest of the year, which would \"aggravate and exacerbate an already perilous situation for many plantation companies.\u201d Labor Squeeze Labor shortages have plagued growers for years, though never this acutely. Malaysia\u2019s plantations are now competing with higher wages offered by the growing industry in Indonesia, the world\u2019s biggest producer, and while benefits and employment practices vary, the industry has a reputation for exploitation and abuse. Automation has offered little relief. Palm fruit is fragile, growing in bunches that can weigh as much as 100 pounds, 60 feet off the ground. Most of it is still harvested by hand. Compared with soy or rapeseed, harvesting palm fruit requires 25 times more workers. The sudden and rapid outbreak of the coronavirus has turned long-term challenges into short-term ones, said Aurelia Britsch, head of commodities at Fitch Solutions. \"The sector is currently recording labor shortages, as ongoing lockdown measures mean palm oil estates are generally unable to recruit new foreign workers at a time when some employees have been repatriated to their origin countries due to the pandemic.\u201d In better times, the farmers might have raised wages to attract more workers. Not now, with global economies in free-fall and commodities prices growing more volatile. Even with a shortage of labor and, potentially, supply, the tropical oil on course for its biggest annual drop since 2012. \u201dThe reality is stark,\u201d United\u2019s Bek-Nielsen said. \"Growers are fearing that field losses will creep up from August-September towards the end of the year in tune with more and more guest workers returning home on leave. It is sadly a one-way traffic for the rest of 2020.\u201d Stopping production is an option for rubber and other crops, a way to use less labor and eat into stockpiles, forcing prices to rise. Palm isn\u2019t that flexible. \"It\u2019s not as simple as stopping production to let prices go up,\u201d said Nageeb. \"The moment you stop your production for two weeks, to bring it back to normal will take two months.\u201d Without enough workers to harvest the crop in a timely way, palm fruit will rot. The fruit that is harvested also has to be sent quickly to crushing mills or it\u2019ll start to oxidize, increasing acidity levels and reducing oil quality. Manual labor\u2019s also required to keep trees pruned and healthy for future seasons. Migrant Exodus For migrant workers, the virus outbreak and the lockdowns that followed have been been grueling. Those who left may not be able to return, losing a steady, if modest, source of income. Those that stayed faced other problems, said Glorene Das, executive director of Tenaganita, a Malaysian NGO that promotes rights of migrant workers and refugees. The government requires employers to provide workers with adequate social distance and protective gear, as well as routinely disinfected work environments. That applies to plantation operators too, but \"the remoteness of these locations and the lack of labor inspectors contribute to difficulty in enforcement,\u201d according to the International Labour Organization. During the lockdown, some plantation workers struggled to get enough food and other basic supplies. Documented and undocumented Indonesian workers are the biggest contingent among Malaysia\u2019s immigrant palm laborers. When the country imposed its nationwide lockdown, many workers on short-stay visas returned to Indonesia, said Zana Amir, program officer at Migrant Care, a Jakarta-headquartered group. \"They feared having no income in Malaysia, as the government conducted raids on illegal workers,\u201d Zana said. The labor shortages are likely to worsen, analysts predict, as governments try to combat the coronavirus-induced recession and rising unemployment. \"In Malaysia, this is likely to lead to stricter immigration regulations,\u201d said Fitch\u2019s Britsch. \"Given plantations\u2019 large reliance on foreign labor, these regulations will aggravate further the rising labor challenges palm oil companies have been facing in recent years.\u201d When and if Malaysia eases restrictions on travel or work visas, workers may not return en masse, said Oscar Tjakra, Singapore-based analyst at Rabobank. \"It will take some time for migrant workers who had left the country to travel back to Malaysia,\u201d he said. \"These migrant workers will monitor the coronavirus outbreak situation and economic situation in Malaysia before deciding to come back.\u201d - Bloomberg\n                \n                "},

Malaysian Employers Federation (MEF) executive director Datuk Shamsuddin Bardan said only a small number of sectors had manpower issues for now due to strict government rules and its requirements for foreign workers. \u201cMost employers are dealing with an excess of workers now rather than a shortage following a sharp decline in the global economy due to Covid-19. \u201cThe areas where the authorities are very strict about when it comes to foreign workers are, for example, some of the wet markets and construction industry, where crackdowns have been instituted,\u201d said Shamsuddin. \u201cThe shortage of foreign workers is only limited to certain sectors, namely construction, plantation and some manufacturing sectors.\u201d He said some manufacturers might still require foreign workers, especially those producing high-demand products, such as personal protective equipment. Shamsuddin said it had been hard for the plantation sector to attract locals due to the mistaken belief that jobs in the plantation are low-class. \u201cBut if we look deeper, plantation workers are provided with proper and furnished housing, land to cultivate in, good facilities and depending on one\u2019s effort to work \u2013 only that they live away from towns and cities,\u201d he said. \u201cA worker doing harvesting work can earn more than RM2,000 a month with most of his needs provided for free but Malaysians are not interested.\u201d Shamsuddin said society needed to change their views of less-favourable jobs, such as those deemed 3D \u2013 dirty, dangerous and difficult. He said such jobs could be \u201crebranded\u201d to attract more Malaysian workers. \u201cWe need to modernise these jobs and make them more attractive. \u201cFor example, in Switzerland, only a licensed plumber can legally carry out any work on the plumbing system in a home,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is about upgrading the profession itself so that it is not seen as less attractive jobs.\u201d He said the government should upgrade the skills required for those who want to work in such sectors, which could mean more investment in training, reskilling and upskilling of existing workers. Shamsuddin noted that Malaysia had enough foreign workers for the time being, and only some of them were in the \u201cwrong sector\u201d that was less in demand now. \u201cThe government should facilitate employers to temporarily redeploy these foreign workers, place them at sectors where they are needed without having to retrench and repatriate them,\u201d he said, adding that retrenching and repatriating were rather simplistic and not helping employers to reduce cost in reviving the economy post-Covid-19. Meanwhile, Indonesia has temporarily stopped sending its domestic workers to Malaysia after the MCO was enforced here, said the embassy\u2019s Information, Social and Cultural Affairs counsellor Agung Cahaya Sumirat. \u201cIn tackling the pandemic, the Indonesian government has temporarily halted sending migrants abroad. \u201cWe will see and evaluate the matter later while considering the development of the virus outbreak,\u201d he said in an interview. Malaysia is one of the main destinations for Indonesian migrant workers. According to the embassy\u2019s official data, there are almost 800,000 Indonesian migrants registered in Malaysia.

The situation is similar to what happened in Singapore with the number of local cases going down and a spike in new cases appearing among foreign workers. Clusters of Covid-19 infections have been detected at three construction sites and three immigration depots. More than 4,000 undocumented immigrants have been detained at these depots for not possessing valid travel and work documents. As the number of cases have increased, some have started to blame foreign workers for the spread of the disease \u2013 but is it justifiable to do so?    Let us first look at the factors that work against efforts to mitigate the spread of the virus. According to the Health director-general Datuk Dr Noor Hisham Abdullah, the main factors are the workers\u2019 crowded living environment and poor hygiene practices. But migrant workers should not be the only ones blamed for such conditions. Aside from probably being uneducated about hygiene, it is very likely that the workers have no choice about living in crowded conditions because that is all they can afford on their low wages or because those are the accommodations that they have been provided by their employers.    Employers who are responsible for this should also bear some of the responsibility. The implementation of standard operating procedures (SOPs) to mitigate the spread of Covid-19 should not only be limited to worksites.    Dr Noor Hisham has called on employers to ensure that physical distancing measures at workers\u2019 accommodations are taken seriously by having beds at least 1m to 2m apart, enough space so they can avoid preparing and consuming food in large groups, and ensuring that toilets and surrounding areas are clean and sanitised.    As stated in the Workers\u2019 Minimum Standards of Housing and Amenities Act (Amended 2019) \u2013 scheduled to have taken effect on June 1, 2020, in Peninsular Malaysia and Labuan \u2013 one of the duties and responsibilities of an employer associated with the current situation is laid out under Section 24J: (f) To take preventive measures to contain the spread of infectious diseases as ordered by the Medical Officer of Health in accordance with relevant written laws, the employer shall, at his own expense, make arrangements as ordered by the Medical Officer of Health so that all or any of the employees be given immunisation against any infectious disease. Another sub-section of Section 24J that is closely related is (b) to take necessary preventive measures to ensure employees\u2019 safety and well-being. So it is actually written into law that it is the employers\u2019 obligation to take action to curb the spread of Covid-19 among their foreign workers.    The right action has been pursued by making it compulsory for foreign workers in all sectors to undergo Covid-19 screening after the rise in the number of cases at construction sites. But the screening has to go along with preventive measures that ensure the workers have appropriate accommodations where they can maintain physical distancing.    On May 28, 2020, Human Resources Minister Datuk Seri M. Saravanan announced that the government is giving employers a grace period of three months, until Aug 31, to comply with the amendments to the Workers\u2019 Minimum Standards of Housing and Amenities Act. However, the deadly nature of the pandemic that could worsen current conditions quickly should be the key reason for employers to not delay complying with the Act. The amendments were passed in Parliament in July 2019, then gazetted in September 2019, so the duration since then should have provided sufficient time for employers. Delaying compliance would be irresponsible, as the spread of Covid-19 places Malaysian citizens at risk along with foreign workers.    Furthermore, as most of the foreign workers are hired for \u201c3D jobs\u201d (dangerous, dirty and difficult), they are accustomed to and accepting of unhygienic surroundings. So awareness about the severity of the pandemic and the need for hygiene to stop the spread of the virus needs to be instilled by educating them on SOPs at worksites and their accommodations.    Although we hope this spike of Covid-19 cases in Malaysia will not be as bad as Singapore\u2019s, as noted by Universiti Malaya public health specialist Dr Rafdzah Ahmad Zaki, prompt measures must be taken because foreign workers make up 15% to 30% of Malaysia\u2019s labour force. Singapore should be a wake-up call for Malaysia, and we can learn lessons from the experience there. The enforcement of the amended Act should not be delayed as it is not only important to prevent the virus spreading widely but also for the well-being of the workers.

For mother-of-two Aracely Mediavilla, the weekly deliveries of food and essential supplies from Barcelona-based volunteers have been a lifeline since she returned to Spain from Ecuador in the hope of getting her elder son medical treatment. \"It's not just a box of food - it's a box of love, of hope,\" said Mediavilla, fighting back tears. \"I am grateful for it because my children have been able to eat and feel loved.\" Mediavilla, 28, lived in Barcelona for years before Spain's 2008 economic crisis, and decided to return when her son Julian was diagnosed with retinopathy which blinded him in one eye. But the coronavirus lockdown, now in its 13th week, made it impossible for Mediavilla to get a job, and with a second newborn boy in tow, she and her mother Alicia rely on the help of a group of parishioners called Maria Auxiliadora, or Mary of Succour. The volunteers, who are associated to Santa Anna church in central Barcelona, gathered funds to provide Mediavilla's son Julian with special glasses. They also helped her land a job as an admnistrative assistant in a laboratory, which she began last week. On one sunny morning outside Santa Anna, the breakfast line stretched far down the street, with volunteers distributing reusable face masks to people as they queued for sacks of basic supplies and a cup of milky coffee. \"We do a breakfast, lunch and dinner service every day,\" said Peio Sanchez, priest at Santa Anna. \"This queue has been increasing, firstly because of the undocumented migrants.\" Undocumented immigrants are often precariously - and informally - employed, making them especially vulnerable to economic shocks and difficult domestic situations, Sanchez said. \"From the second month (we attended) people who had not received the corresponding aid and who no longer had the resources to pay for food and rent,\" Sanchez added. The priest expects Barcelona's homeless population - currently 1,500 - to triple in the next two years. Similar scenes have played out in Aluche, a poor neighbourhood in the capital Madrid. Spain's strict lockdown cost the economy 900,000 jobs in the second half of March alone. Last week, Spain approved an income support programme for about 2.5 million of its poorest citizens, set at about half the minimum wage of 1,108 euros $1,244.84) per month.

The government will also launch next year the 12th Malaysia Plan (2021-2025), which will outline the medium and longer term policies for achieving our nation's development goals and provide the public sector expenditure programme to implement such policies.    In carrying out its development plans for economic and social progress, the government must place more focus on the human aspects of development to empower the people to face the challenges that lie ahead, such as a second round of the pandemic and the uncertainties arising from the geo-political tensions around the world.    We will have to increasingly rely on our own domestic strength to remain resilient against the adverse external developments. Hence, our development plans must place greater attention on improving the quality of the education and training system to create the internal capacity for growth and prosperity. They should equip school leavers and graduates with a stronger foundation to learn new skills.    Employers prefer to recruit job applicants who are trainable to raise their productivity and technical skills. New entrants to the labour market who are good in Maths, Science and English and who impress employers with their confident personality will find it easier to get the better paid jobs.    Those whose parents can afford to send their children for private tuition in Maths, Science, languages, music and art tend to have the advantage in having these superior qualities in them. There is a growing number of children who go to expensive private schools locally and abroad. These are the children of privileged families, political and corporate elites and the middle class.    This division of success in finding good jobs between income classes is not healthy for national unity. The national education system should therefore introduce reforms to provide the quality required in the employment market. Education should be free from racial, religious and communal politics to allow reforms to be successfully implemented so that all youths will have a level playing field in life.    In general, wage levels in Malaysia are low relative to its per capita GDP and standard of development. The main reason is the weak labour policies on employment and lack of controls on importing foreign workers. Irresponsible employers are taking advantage of undocumented workers, who out-number their legal counterparts, to suppress wage levels and ignore workers rights across all segments of the labour market. The culture of low wages spreads to all levels of employment, including executives. The result is that the share of wages in national income in Malaysia is low by international standards, thus indicating an imbalance in the distribution of the country\u2019s wealth between owners of capital and the working class.    Depressed wage levels explain much of the hardships among households living in the major urban centres. In addition, urban households struggle with the higher cost of living in cities compared to the rest of the country.    As our planners work on policies for the recovery of the economy and its long-term growth, they would prioritise projects that have a high impact on generating employment and income opportunities. This is to be expected as GDP growth is essential to lift up income levels.    At the same time, our planning agencies should also strengthen the education and labour policies to make them more dynamic in providing our working population with better wages and a higher share of the national income.    With higher levels of skills, the talent pool will be enhanced and facilitate Malaysia\u2019s efforts to attract more local and foreign investment into high technology and state-of-the-art industries, as the East Asian Tigers have done to restructure their economy and    become so advanced in their standards of living. They placed high priority on investing in their human resources to transform into high income countries within a short period of one generation.

Afghanistan's foreign ministry said in a statement on Friday three Afghans were killed and four injured in Iran's central Yazd province after their vehicle was shot at by Iranian police, triggering the fire.  Video footage posted on social media showed a boy escaping from the blazing car with burns on parts of his body and begging for water. The ministry said the video was genuine and Afghans in Iran were trying to identify the victims. The boy's plea of \"give me some water, I am burning\" was widely circulated on social media and taken up by rights group demanding justice. \"Iran has no right to kill Afghan refugees, they can seal their borders, expel all Afghans but not kill them,\" said Ali Noori, a lawyer and rights activist said on Facebook. Afghans have for decades sought refuge in Iran from war and poverty in their homeland. Iran says about 2.5 million Afghan migrants, both legal and undocumented, live there. Facing its own economic problems worsened by international sanctions, Iran has at times tried to send Afghans home. Last month, Afghan officials said Iranian border guards killed 45 Afghan migrant workers by forcing them at gunpoint into a mountain torrent on the border. At the time, Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi issued a statement saying only that the incident in question had taken place on Afghan soil. Iranian embassy officials in Afghan capital, Kabul were not immediately available for comment on the latest incident.

South Korea\u2019s Centre for Disease Control and Prevention on Tuesday (May 26) also reported two more deaths, bringing national totals to 11,225 and 269 fatalities. Officials linked three of the new cases to international arrivals. South Korea has been reporting around 20 new cases per day over the past two weeks after health workers found hundreds of infections linked to clubgoers who went out in early May as the country eased on social distancing. The caseload has slowed from early March when it was reporting hundreds of new cases a day, but the new infections in the greater capital area has caused concern as authorities proceed with a phased reopening of schools, which began with high school seniors last week. Around 2.4 million high school juniors, middle school seniors, first- and second-grade elementary school children and kindergartners will be returning to school on Wednesday. Health Minister Park Neung-hoo during a virus meeting urged school officials to double-check their preventive measures. He called for authorities to strengthen monitoring on some 390,000 undocumented foreign nationals who may have poor access to medical services and tests, but related measures weren\u2019t immediately announced. South Korea also Tuesday began requiring people to wear masks on public transit and while using taxis. People in South Korea, like in much of Asia, have generally worn masks in public settings and no major disruptions were reported. Health authorities have left mask enforcement to bus drivers and subway station workers. Taxi drivers are allowed to refuse picking up passengers if they aren\u2019t wearing masks. South Korea since March has banned the exports of masks and channelled most domestically produced masks to pharmacies, where people are currently limited to buying three masks per week. The nationwide rationing was a drastic attempt at calming public anger over shortages, but supply has stabilised. - AP\n                \n                "},

At a press conference held on May 22, Senior Minister Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri Yaakob stated that the 60 confirmed positive cases in Bukit Jalil have been in the centre before the movement control order (MCO) took effect on March 18, and that all 114 of the Immigration officers on duty have tested negative.    While the government has stated that it will be screening detainees, testing alone is not a foolproof measure of preventing the spread of the virus. If the testing is only done once, there is no guarantee that the person would be free from infection, as the infected person may test negative because the test is unable to detect new exposure to infection within five days.    We are aware that three weeks are sufficient to trigger two to three generations of the spread of the virus. Given the pre-existing cramped conditions in the centres and the pressure that will be placed on the infrastructure with more detainees being brought in, we have grave concerns regarding the government\u2019s ability to prevent the transmission of disease.    Contrary to prevailing logic, the government\u2019s punitive approach toward undocumented migrant workers and refugees during this time of crisis poses a public health risk \u2013 for example, some individuals attempted escape from enhanced MCO areas. It also hurts the local economy as many sectors do rely on such workers for their day-to-day operations. It further puts Immigration officers at grave risk of contracting the disease and transmitting it to their family members.    Regrettably, the arrests of undocumented migrant workers by the government at this time has also had another inadvertent impact: It has made immigrant communities distrustful of the health system. This erodes the tremendous efforts made by the Health Ministry to combat this pandemic.    Civil society groups worked hard to be the bridge between immigrant communities and the government to build trust in the health system, which is critical to controlling this outbreak. Upon assurances from the Health Ministry in the early days of the pandemic, they encouraged immigrant and refugee communities to come out for Covid-19 screening voluntarily and without fear. Although non-citizens and the trust they place in a country\u2019s health system may not appear to be a matter of importance from a legal point of view, it is critical from a public health perspective in arresting the spread of disease. Non-health-related ministries need to understand the importance of respecting public health principles while we are in the midst of an outbreak of a disease that has no proven treatment, and that relies critically on prevention of disease transmission to stop spreading.    In this connection, the government must remember that as a member of the global community, the United Nations and the World Health Organisation, it has a higher duty of care towards incarcerated people as well as an obligation to control the spread of the pandemic regionally and globally. The detection of Covid-19 in deported immigrants, as in the case of the immigrants from Myanmar, does not augur well for Malaysia\u2019s international reputation. This is the time for nations to show solidarity and support for battling what is a global pandemic.    Finally, it cannot be over-emphasised that taking care and monitoring the health of large immigrant communities in the country is a way to also protect co-existing local communities.    As such we urgently call upon the government to:    >  Immediately stop the arrests of undocumented immigrants, refugees and asylum seekers as well as stateless persons without documents.    >  Allow the Health Ministry to take the lead in efforts to control the spread of Covid-19, including among non-citizens, and support the ministry in its efforts to combat the pandemic.    >  Invite Suhakam (the Human Rights Commission of Malaysia) to undertake a monitoring visit to detention centres to provide an independent report of the events leading to the detection of Covid-19 cases in them, and to ensure that strong preventive measures are being taken to control disease transmission in the centres.    >  Cooperate with international agencies and civil society organisations to increase detainees\u2019 access to hygiene products and other necessary supplies and to allow the UN High Commission on Refugees to identify and register Persons of Concern.    >  Develop a coherent and rational migration policy framework that links with an effective blueprint of the country\u2019s human resources needs.    >  Preserve the rule of law by taking action against xenophobic hate speech against immigrant communities whose contributions over the years have built this country.

It made me especially proud to belong to the public health sector as everybody rallied and worked tirelessly to ensure that we provided the best and safest care to all of our patients while ensuring that we remained safe ourselves. The spectre of getting infected ourselves was real, as we learned of the thousands of healthcare workers who had become infected with Covid-19 and the hundreds who have died from it around the world.

Without a doubt we can be proud of Malaysia\u2019s timely actions and achievements in the country\u2019s response to the Covid-19 threat.

Given that the pandemic is not going to be going away anytime soon, for us frontliners the challenge will be to maintain these high standards of care and service delivery while adhering to physical distancing and infection control procedures in the long foreseeable future.    Ramadan was also a time for self-reflection, a time and opportunity to reflect on what the pandemic has meant to us as individuals and what it means to our society as a whole. Beyond the inconvenience of the movement control order (MCO) and the fear and anxiety of getting infected, I am sure Covid-19 has meant different things to different people. It has certainly taught me a lot of lessons and made me reflect deeply on what is important and what matters less so. It is a humbling experience to live through this pandemic and see how a 125nm particle has brought the whole world to its knees. From the original epicentre in Wuhan, China, to the wealthy Italian region of Lombardy to bustling New York City, no country has been spared as these little particles found their way across the world and infected more than five million people and killed over 300 000 people in just five short months. The tragedy of this pandemic will one day not only be counted in the number infected and the lives lost but also in how quickly and effectively governments and leaders responded as the epidemic unfolded.    Much has been said about the Covid-19 pandemic bringing to the fore inequalities and divisions in society. It is encouraging that the previously deafening, divisive racial rhetoric in our country has been somewhat muted throughout this epidemic \u2013 though, unfortunately, that has been replaced by the demonisation of foreign workers and undocumented immigrants. Just like the HIV epidemic before it, the Covid-19 pandemic hits especially hard those already vulnerable and marginalised by society. While some of us moan about MCO period restrictions, to many there MCO has meant a loss of income and, to some, even a loss of basic dignity. \u201cWe may be in the same storm, but not all of us are in the same boat\u201d is a saying that vividly captures the inequality that has deepened through this crisis.    We still have many more months of the pandemic to live through and the report card is still out. At this stage we seem to have passed the epidemic control test but as we move forward, the question is will we pass the bigger test? Will we take stock and learn from the devastation of Covid-19 and move towards a more compassionate, mutually respectful, inclusive, equal and just society? Will we continue to close a blind eye to the destruction of the environment in the name of profit and greed? Will we permit science and evidence to inform and guide our policies or will we continue to allow ideology and self-interest to rule?    As a woman of science I try and keep pace with the unprecedented speed and volume of the scientific knowledge on SARS-CoV-2 and use it to inform and improve patient care as well as public health policies. As a woman of faith, I cannot help but feel that Allah swt has unleashed these 125nm particles upon us to make us stop, reflect, learn and find ways in which we can make ourselves and this world a better place, for ourselves and the people we will one day leave it to, our children and their children after them. As a Muslim, there could not have been a better time to do so than the Ramadan just passed.

The Senior Minister (Security) said the decision was made at a meeting on Tuesday (May 26) morning between the various ministries and departments involved including the Home Ministry.    He said they would get the assistance of the various embassies to deport the undocumented migrants.    \u201cThey will undergo screening before they are deported. Only those who are negative will be deported, \u201d he said during a daily press briefing on the Covid-19 situation on Tuesday.    He also said that anyone linked to the three Immigration detention depots in Bukit Jalil, Semenyih and Sepang would have to undergo a swab test.    There are 227 positive cases from the three detention depots involving undocumented migrants so far, with those from Bangladesh recording the highest number at 53 cases.    The rest are from India (41), Indonesia (38), Myanmar (37), Pakistan (28), China (17), Cambodia (4), Nepal (3), Sri Lanka (2) and one each from the Philippines, Libya, Egypt and Syria.

The Deputy Tourism, Arts and Culture Minister said this forum was aimed at engaging stakeholders and the public to gather feedback and find solutions to resolve the problem of illegal immigrants, particularly in Sabah.    \u201cThe Covid-19 pandemic has in a way created an unprecedented opportunity in highlighting the presence of the millions of illegal and unlawful foreigners in Malaysia,\u201d Jeffrey said in a statement here on Tuesday (May 26).    He cited as examples various news reports over the arrests of illegal immigrants in Sabah as well as reports of attempted entry by Rohingya in Langkawi and north-western Peninsular Malaysia.    Jeffrey said illegal immigrants and undocumented foreigners in Malaysia had been receiving much media coverage and causing social media anger from netizens recently.    \u201cThese foreigners and illegals pose a huge threat, not just because of the Covid-19 infections and social problems. A long-term sustainable solution needs to be put in place,\u201d Jeffrey said.    He said the time has come for concerted efforts by all stakeholders and connected parties to sit down and work out a holistic long-term plan to deal with illegal immigrants and undocumented persons in Malaysia.    He said he has nothing against legal foreigners entering Sabah via proper means, but not through backdoor routes.    \u201cBy all means, they are welcome in Malaysia - but it must be through the proper immigration channels with proper documentation from their home countries,\u201d Jeffrey said.

The Malaysian authorities have swept up hundreds of undocumented workers in raids amid its movement control order, while its neighbour Indonesia, home to most of them, is repatriating its citizens. Just as Singapore has struggled to deal with a coronavirus outbreak that spread quickly through its population of foreign workers in dormitories, countries with large numbers of low-wage migrant workers are grappling with similar issues. From Asia to the Middle East, the Covid-19 (coronavirus) pandemic is exposing the unique vulnerabilities of the world's estimated 164 million low-paid migrant workers, who toil at the jobs locals do not want, to save money and get a leg up back home. While some appear to have escaped the same sort of outbreak Singapore is dealing with, activists say good examples of how to manage this segment of their population are few and far between. As Covid-19 takes its toll on economies and public health in many countries, low-wage migrant worker populations have largely been affected disproportionately. Observers say problems include poor living conditions, insufficient legal protection and limited access to healthcare. Last month, Saudi Arabia had shipped home nearly 3,000 of the estimated 200,000 Ethiopians living there before the United Nations called for a halt. In Kuwait last month, at least a dozen migrant workers took their own lives or attempted to, according to migrant-rights.org, an activist website, citing media reports. In Thailand, hundreds of thousands of workers from neighbouring countries like Myanmar, Laos and Cambodia are said to have fled home after a lockdown left them with the prospect of being stuck without money or food. n Malaysia, police rounded up 200 undocumented workers last week alone in Petaling Jaya, outside Kuala Lumpur, even as officials gradually ease movement restrictions. The country is thought to have at least five million migrant workers. Indonesia, one of the world's biggest contributors of labour, has repatriated more than 130,000 of its citizens working abroad as construction workers, cruise ship staff and housekeepers, as well as students. David Welsh, country director of the South-East Asia branch of the Solidarity Centre, a non-profit organisation aligned with the United States-based labour federation AFL-CIO, said the crisis has exposed the poor conditions many migrant workers face. \"Migrant workers have been left aside by governments who have relied on them to do dangerous jobs that have become even more dangerous during this crisis,\" Welsh said. Then, there is Qatar, where observers say criticism of the country's treatment of migrant labour in the wake of its successful bid to host the Fifa World Cup in 2022 has sparked changes that are a lesson to others but also a demonstration of how difficult the process is going to be. Like in Singapore, the outbreak in Qatar has centred on its foreign workers, who outnumber Qataris in the workforce by nearly 20 to one. Total infections have ticked past 40,000 in a country with 2.8 million people. Last October, it abolished exit visas for departing workers and did away with discriminatory laws assigning minimum wages by nationality. The monarchy at the same time abolished the sponsorship rules that tie workers to jobs and make them vulnerable to abuse. The country's new minimum wage laws also override bilateral agreements with countries of origin that can see a Bangladeshi welder, for example, earning two-thirds what a Filipino might. Qatar's ambition to host the World Cup has helped prompt the changes. Shortly after securing the event a decade ago, Qatar publicly promised four weeks' paid leave, overtime and other benefits to workers employed by the contractors awarded work. Contractors erecting more than half a dozen stadiums and other needed infrastructure offer workers attractive terms that meet the scrutiny of activists and unions. Apolinar Tolentino, regional representative for the Building and Wood Workers' International Asia-Pacific, said his union has had regular access to inspect work sites and dormitories where workers are housed four to an air-conditioned room and bunk beds are banned. The visits included group interviews with workers to assess conditions including health and safety, food quality and even Internet speeds. \"Qatar is setting an example in the region of how to treat its migrant labour,\" said Tolentino. But he acknowledges that the improvement has not been even. Earlier this month, the government began easing a two-month lockdown of the sprawling Industrial Area outside of Doha, where hundreds of thousands of workers were holed up in dormitories. The government requires all employers to pay furloughed workers, but there have been reports of workers stranded and begging for food. The problem is fuelled in part by undocumented foreign workers relying on short-term casual work, who do not have regular employers. \"Compliance with standards outside the World Cup projects are more challenging,\" Tolentino said. \"There is almost no direct access by international organisations.\" Last month, Amnesty International and a coalition of non-governmental organisations and trade unions sent letters to Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Bahrain, Kuwait and Oman, raising concerns about migrant workers. Amnesty International's Middle East research director Lynn Maalouf said: \"While some governments made promising commitments to support migrant workers, much more needs to be done to ensure Covid-19 will not result in further human rights violations and greater suffering for migrant workers in these countries.\" - The Straits Times/Asian News Network\n                \n                "},

Senior Minister (Security) Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri Yaakob  (pic ) said even those who entered the country illegally are treated in a humane manner by the Malaysian government.    \u201cForeigners with valid work permits are protected. For example, those working the estates are given housing. Those in other sectors get all kinds of benefits from employers.    \u201cWe take care of their welfare, there is no issue. We acknowledge that we need them for dangerous, dirty and difficult (3D) jobs.    \u201cAs for those who entered the country illegally and do not have valid documents, we have to take action against them. Even then, we do it humanely. When we find that some of them are Covid-19 positive at our depots, we screen all of them -100% - so that they can be saved.    \u201cWe send them to MAEPS (Malaysia Agro Exposition Park Serdang) to be treated. If you check out MAEPS, it is such a nice place and the government has spent millions of ringgit to set it up (as a Covid-19 hospital).    \u201cIf we are worried about an increasing number of positive cases among them, there are two more places they can be placed at. So to call the government inhumane is not fair, \u201d he said.    Ismail Sabri added that the treatment does not change anything about their status.    \u201cThey entered the country illegally and do not have any right to be here. We are in talks with their home countries to take them back. We do not even want to jail them here, \u201d said Ismail Sabri at the National Security Council (MKN)\u2019s daily Covid-19 press conference here.    Ismail Sabri was asked about claims that the Malaysian government had not treated its foreign workers humanely during the Covid-19 pandemic.    On the rounding up of undocumented migrants during the enhanced movement control order (MCO), Ismail Sabri said it had to be done.    \u201cWhen the enhanced MCO is lifted and the barbed wires are removed, the residents of the area are free to move - including those who are undocumented. If we allow them to be free, then it is wrong because they are illegals.    \u201cWe are not taking advantage of them. We send them to our detention depots. If they test negative for Covid-19, we will deport them.    \u201cIt is not nice to accuse Malaysia of mistreatment. In fact, other countries treat them (undocumented migrants) worse. There is no need for politicians or NGOs to act as heroes for undocumented migrants, \u201d he said.    On the capacity of the temporary hospital in MAEPS, Ismail Sabri said it can accommodate 600 patients - with 230 beds in use so far.    \u201cBesides MAEPS, we also have the unused leprosy centre in the Sungai Buloh Hospital and the former maternity wards at the Kuala Lumpur Hospital, giving us a capacity of 1,430 beds, \u201d he said.

The Senior Minister said the government has assigned three facilities to house patients from the immigration depot clusters, with a total capacity of about 1,430 beds.    The three places are the Malaysia Agro Exposition Park Serdang (MAEPS), Hospital Sungai Buloh\u2019s leprosy centre and the unused maternity ward at Hospital Kuala Lumpur.    \u201cWe are ready. So far, we only have 230 patients at MAEPS. MAEPS can accommodate 600 patients.    \u201cIn total, all three facilities can put up 1,430 patients. So even if there is an increase in cases, we have enough places, \u201d he said at the National Security Council\u2019s daily Covid-19 press briefing here.

He said those without documents were of illegal status in the country no matter what, adding that it was the Immigration Department\u2019s duty to manage them.    \u201cNothing changes their status.

On a related matter, Ismail Sabri, who is also Defence Minister, said 824 motorists that attempted interstate travel without permission on Tuesday were told to turn back - an increase from the 738 attempts recorded the day before.    He said the police has also detained 136 individuals, of which 75 were remanded while 61 were on bail for defying the conditional movement control order (MCO).    \u201cCompounds were also issued to 534 individuals for various offences under the conditional MCO, \u201d he said.    States that recorded the highest number of attempts to cross borders are Selangor (284), Kedah (122) and Melaka (113).    Ismail Sabri also said that audit firms that instructed their staff to work in different states were breaching the conditional MCO.    \u201cAs I have mentioned previously, interstate travels are only for emergencies such as a death or for close family members to visit those who are very ill.    \u201cAuditors wanting to check accounts of (their clients) is obviously not part of it. An audit isn\u2019t even an emergency, \u201d he said.

Instead, Aegile Fernandez \u2013 who has 37 years of experience in immigration and human-trafficking issues \u2013 said the government should work with NGOs, civil society and employers to educate migrant workers about the pandemic.    \u201cIf the undocumented foreign workers are treated with kindness, they will seek treatment if they are ill, \u201d she said.    Early this week, most of the Covid-19 clusters were discovered at three immigration detention depots and centres (DTIs) in Sepang, Bukit Jalil and Semenyih.    Health director-general Datuk Dr Noor Hisham Abdullah said that of the 172 cases tested positive in the country on Monday, 112 were from the DTIs.    The next day, 173 foreigners tested positive. Thirteen were security guards from Cheras.    The spike in cases, three-digit figures since May 3, has the public concerned but Dr Noor Hisham assured everyone that the DTIs were in isolated areas and under control by local authorities.    On the same day, Senior Minister Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri Yaakob said the government would send DTI detainees to Covid-19 makeshift hospitals and deport those who were free of Covid-19.    Infectious disease consultant Datuk Dr Christopher Lee concurred with Aegile.    \u201cIf we feel they are a major risk group based on their close living conditions, then we need to engage them rather than make them hide from the authorities, \u201d he said.    Dr Lee also said that if the undocumented workers had acquired the infection inside the camps, then the authorities needed to sort out the hygiene and social distancing issues there although it would pose a challenge due to the huge numbers.    \u201cEthically, we still have to try our best to minimise the risks, \u201d he said.    Universiti Malaya senior research consultant academician Emeritus Prof Datuk Dr Lam Sai Kit also said the Immigration Department should not detain undocumented migrants at this stage to prevent overcrowding.    \u201cDetainees should be educated on how the virus is spread and about personal hygiene, including wearing of face masks, \u201d he said.    However, consultant public health physician Datuk Lokman Hakim Sulaiman agreed with the authorities that detaining undocumented workers would help minimise Covid-19\u2019s spread to the general public and those tested negative should be deported.    \u201cWho will foot their bill if all undocumented workers are required to be tested?\u201d he said. \n                \n                "},

H.H. Tan, who owns a tile and flooring company as well as a construction company, said he ensured his 14 Indonesian workers have ample personal space.    \u201cI have a double-storey house for them and each bedroom has one to two occupants only.    \u201cI have also forbidden any socialising with outsiders and have taken it upon myself to do all their shopping for them, \u201d he said.

The workers\u2019 temperatures were taken and recorded every morning before they go to the worksite.    Meanwhile, state investment, industry and trade, small and medium industries committee chairman Datuk Teng Chang Khim said the Selangor government was helping the Health Ministry in its efforts to detect and curb Covid-19 infection among construction workers.    \u201cThe state cannot take the lead on this matter and thus we are doing everything possible to complement the initiatives taken by the ministry, \u2019\u2019 said Teng.    This included having a budget to go towards carrying out screening of construction workers and providing whatever else was required by the Health Ministry.    \u201cFor instance, if the ministry has insufficient personal protective gears, we will provide them with these, \u2019\u2019 said Teng, adding that the Health Ministry was doing the right thing to stem Covid-19 cases in the construction industry.    Teng said sending home undocumented workers who were Covid-19 negative as well as random testing was the only viable option at the moment.    Meanwhile, state health, welfare, women empowerment and family committee chairman Dr Siti Mariah Mahmud said RM2.06mil has been allocated by the Selangor government for screening of high risk groups.    \u201cWe\u2019ll be having a meeting with Mentri Besar Datuk Seri Amirudin Shari, the state health department as well as Selangor Task Force for Covid-19 on June 1 to determine all the high risk groups for screening, \u2019\u2019 said Dr Siti Mariah.    She added that PPEs were also being produced by the state\u2019s Women Development Centre in collaboration with Hospital Banting.    In Sabah, things are rough. Many construction sites are not running due to employers\u2019 inability to get their workers tested for Covid-19.    Sabah Builders Association (SBA) president Lou Chi Nam said that feedback from SBA\u2019s 100-odd members was that most of them would not begin work until June \u2013 and if the conditional MCO were to be over.\u201cOne of the requirements to start operating is that these workers must have gotten tested for the virus and results obtained, \u201d he said. \u201cBut since many are not able to, mainly due to the cost, they cannot operate, \u201d he said.    Lou said those who could afford to pay for their workers\u2019 swab tests also had to wait for a long period as there was a limit to the number of tests health officials could conduct in a day. \n                \n                "},

Meanwhile, he also said he had an online meeting with Senior Minister (Security) Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri Yaakob and Health director-general Datuk Dr Noor Hisham Abdullah to get the latest updates on the Covid-19 situation in the country.    \u201cIn the 40-minute meeting, a few matters were discussed, among them was having a campaign to encourage community leaders to empower their constituents with responsibilities to protect the community from the virus infection.    \u201cI believe this campaign will educate people to be more responsible for adhering the stipulated standard operating procedures (SOPs) and subsequently lessen the burden on frontliners.    \u201cThis is an important step in the exit plan for the conditional movement control order (MCO), which is also the last criteria to fulfil before the order can be lifted,\u201d he said, adding that the meeting also touched on repatriating undocumented migrants who have been tested negative for Covid-19.    He said he had directed that the process be quickened to reduce the risks of infection among the migrants at detention depots.    \u201cI am satisfied with the outcome in our efforts to fight the pandemic as briefed to me.    \u201cWith all citizens cooperating and taking responsibilities to take care of their own communities, I believe we will succeed in ending the Covid-19 chain of infection,\u201d he added.      \n                \n                "},

Its executive director Datuk Shamsuddin Bardan said the government\u2019s decision to enforce the amendment to the Workers\u2019 Minimum Standards of Housing and Amenities Act on June 1 was insensitive and did not take into account the problems faced by employers.    \u201cInstead, the government should assist employers by guiding them and workers on how Covid-19 can be prevented at their quarters.\u201d    The amendment will now include workers from all industries, including construction, with a three-month grace period granted to employers to implement it.    Shamsuddin said the minimum space requirement per worker living in a permanent dwelling is 4.8sq m while temporary dwelling is 3sq m.    \u201cThe space required for individual employees is demanding and costly and yet the maximum allowable charge on accommodation currently is only RM50 per worker, way below the centralised housing cost of RM100 to RM150 at market rate.    \u201cSome employers may have to send home some foreign workers because they don\u2019t have enough financial resources to comply with it,\u201d he said, adding that the government should target undocumented workers in which most Covid-19 cases were detected.    He also said that the grace period was too short as they were trying to cope with the requirements under the conditional movement control order to revive businesses.    Shamsuddin said providing \u201ckongsi\u201d type accommodation at construction sites would no longer be feasible under the new law.    \u201cAccommodation will be further away from construction sites and there is a need to provide transportation, which adds cost and travel time,\u201d he said.    However, Malaysian Medical Association president Dr N. Ganabaskaran welcomed the government\u2019s move, saying that workers should not be living in cramped rooms and a limit must be set on the number of workers per room.    \u201cPhysical distancing and good personal hygiene must be observed. Their accommodation must also be kept clean and disinfected,\u201d he said.    Dr Ganabaskaran said employers should also appoint team leaders to ensure preventive measures were enforced as part of the standard operating procedure (SOP).    \u201cRegular checks at construction sites and foreign workers\u2019 accommodation should be conducted by the authorities,\u201d he said, adding that fines should be issued for non-compliance.    He also said sharing of food and drinks among the workers should not be allowed. \n                \n                "},

Federation of Malaysian Manufacturers (FMM) president Tan Sri Soh Thian Lai said the amendments to the Minimum Standards of Housing and Amenities (Amendment) Act was a good decision in the long term as it would ensure conducive housing condition for all workers, and enhance the health and productivity of the workforce in the country.    However, Soh said the amendments, which would come into force on June 1 in Peninsular Malaysia and the Federal Territory of Labuan, could pose some challenges to fulfilling them.    The Human Resources Ministry said the government would give a three-month grace period until Aug 31 to give room for employers to make the necessary arrangements.    The enforcement under the Act will begin on Sept 1. The amendments to the Act was passed in Parliament last July and was gazetted on Sept 18.    \u201cBut with the huge number of foreign workers in Malaysia, around two million documented and about four million undocumented, it could pose a big challenge to fulfil conditions under the amendments of the Act within 15 months, including the three-month grace period as all affected employers who employ foreign workers must comply with it, \u201d said Soh.    \u201cNow that the highest risk clusters of Covid-19 infections are foreign workers, this Act is timely \u2013 but it\u2019s too short a time to get the employers prepared.    \u201cWe urge the authorities to give more time, at least six months, for companies to reset and rearrange according to the standard operating procedure (SOP), \u201d Soh said.    Soh said the government should now focus on the construction sites and quarters of foreign workers in the yellow and red zones as they were the high-risk clusters.    \u201cThe most important thing is for all companies with foreign workers to follow the SOP set by the Health Ministry and authorities to minimise the risks, \u201d he said.    Master Builders Association of Malaysia (MBAM) president Foo Chek Lee said it was in full support of the implementation of the amendment, which it helped to draft years ago.    \u201cA worker needs a good place to stay and rest.    \u201cIf they don\u2019t have proper rest, they can\u2019t work and if their living condition is not good, they will get sick and it affects productivity, \u201d he said.    Foo said big construction companies would not have problems to provide housing according to the guidelines.    He pointed out that some workers, however, were labourers who did not have permanent employment and chose to live in cramped conditions to save money.    \u201cThe main contractor and project owners are liable to provide proper accommodation to foreign workers.    \u201cHowever, some sub-contractors may still resort to providing housing in the form of kongsi or hostel but now they would have to follow the guidelines under the amendments, \u201d he said.    Foo, however, said the grace period was tight as it did not give much time for companies to prepare.    \u201cBut this is an extraordinary time with Covid-19, so companies will have to push and make it happen to safeguard public health, \u201d Foo added.    Real Estate and Housing Developers Association (Rehda) national council member Tony Khoo Boon Chuan said there was confusion on the ground as the detailed SOP was not available.    When asked on the ramification of the amendments, Khoo said the extra cost from providing housing, according to guidelines, would be transferred to home buyers eventually.    \u201cThis will result in more expensive houses and properties, \u201d he said.    Bina Puri Holdings group executive director Matthew Tee said although the amendments came at a cost, the industry would have to manage it.    \u201cWe try to follow the guidelines but all these implementations come at a cost, at a time when the construction sector is undergoing a recession, \u201d said Tee. \n                \n                "},

The decision, he said, was made yesterday following a meeting between various departments along with the Home and Works ministries.    Ismail Sabri noted that the meeting was called after a huge number of detainees in three immigration centres were found to be Covid-19 positive.

The government will also launch next year the 12th Malaysia Plan (2021-2025), which will outline the medium and longer term policies for achieving our nation's development goals and provide the public sector expenditure programme to implement such policies.    In carrying out its development plans for economic and social progress, the government must place more focus on the human aspects of development to empower the people to face the challenges that lie ahead, such as a second round of the pandemic and the uncertainties arising from the geo-political tensions around the world.    We will have to increasingly rely on our own domestic strength to remain resilient against the adverse external developments. Hence, our development plans must place greater attention on improving the quality of the education and training system to create the internal capacity for growth and prosperity. They should equip school leavers and graduates with a stronger foundation to learn new skills.    Employers prefer to recruit job applicants who are trainable to raise their productivity and technical skills. New entrants to the labour market who are good in Maths, Science and English and who impress employers with their confident personality will find it easier to get the better paid jobs.    Those whose parents can afford to send their children for private tuition in Maths, Science, languages, music and art tend to have the advantage in having these superior qualities in them. There is a growing number of children who go to expensive private schools locally and abroad. These are the children of privileged families, political and corporate elites and the middle class.    This division of success in finding good jobs between income classes is not healthy for national unity. The national education system should therefore introduce reforms to provide the quality required in the employment market. Education should be free from racial, religious and communal politics to allow reforms to be successfully implemented so that all youths will have a level playing field in life.    In general, wage levels in Malaysia are low relative to its per capita GDP and standard of development. The main reason is the weak labour policies on employment and lack of controls on importing foreign workers. Irresponsible employers are taking advantage of undocumented workers, who out-number their legal counterparts, to suppress wage levels and ignore workers rights across all segments of the labour market. The culture of low wages spreads to all levels of employment, including executives. The result is that the share of wages in national income in Malaysia is low by international standards, thus indicating an imbalance in the distribution of the country\u2019s wealth between owners of capital and the working class.    Depressed wage levels explain much of the hardships among households living in the major urban centres. In addition, urban households struggle with the higher cost of living in cities compared to the rest of the country.    As our planners work on policies for the recovery of the economy and its long-term growth, they would prioritise projects that have a high impact on generating employment and income opportunities. This is to be expected as GDP growth is essential to lift up income levels.    At the same time, our planning agencies should also strengthen the education and labour policies to make them more dynamic in providing our working population with better wages and a higher share of the national income.    With higher levels of skills, the talent pool will be enhanced and facilitate Malaysia\u2019s efforts to attract more local and foreign investment into high technology and state-of-the-art industries, as the East Asian Tigers have done to restructure their economy and    become so advanced in their standards of living. They placed high priority on investing in their human resources to transform into high income countries within a short period of one generation.

The government has eased restrictions for non-contact sports under the conditional MCO such as jogging, badminton and golf. \n                \n                "},

Afghanistan's foreign ministry said in a statement on Friday three Afghans were killed and four injured in Iran's central Yazd province after their vehicle was shot at by Iranian police, triggering the fire.  Video footage posted on social media showed a boy escaping from the blazing car with burns on parts of his body and begging for water. The ministry said the video was genuine and Afghans in Iran were trying to identify the victims. The boy's plea of \"give me some water, I am burning\" was widely circulated on social media and taken up by rights group demanding justice. \"Iran has no right to kill Afghan refugees, they can seal their borders, expel all Afghans but not kill them,\" said Ali Noori, a lawyer and rights activist said on Facebook. Afghans have for decades sought refuge in Iran from war and poverty in their homeland. Iran says about 2.5 million Afghan migrants, both legal and undocumented, live there. Facing its own economic problems worsened by international sanctions, Iran has at times tried to send Afghans home. Last month, Afghan officials said Iranian border guards killed 45 Afghan migrant workers by forcing them at gunpoint into a mountain torrent on the border. At the time, Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi issued a statement saying only that the incident in question had taken place on Afghan soil. Iranian embassy officials in Afghan capital, Kabul were not immediately available for comment on the latest incident.

{"title": "\n            Malaysia farms face US$3 billion hit from palm oil worker shortage\n        ", "region": "AseanPlus News\n                        ", "date": 0, "text": "\n                 \n                                                \n                KUALA LUMPUR: The Covid-19 (coronavirus) pandemic has left Malaysia\u2019s palm oil industry without enough workers, a shortage that could cost farmers as much as 25% of their annual production -- a loss worth about US$2.8 billion. Malaysia\u2019s economy relies on palm oil, its most important agricultural commodity, but palm oil needs migrant workers from Indonesia, Bangladesh and India to do jobs locals won\u2019t. As countries in South-East Asia struggle to get the Covid-19 outbreak under control, governments have tightened restrictions on travel for workers both coming and going. \"In the past, when people left, people also came,\u201d said Nageeb Wahab, chief executive at the Malaysian Palm Oil Association, a growers\u2019 group that represents 40% of palm plantations by area. \"Now, the coming is nil, and the leaving may be more after Malaysia\u2019s movement control order.\u201d Though environmental activists have pushed to rein in the palm industry for years, the labor shortage there signals the disruption unfolding at companies and farms around the world that depend on migrant workers. More than 70% of the country\u2019s plantation workers come from outside Malaysia\u2019s borders, according to an estimate by Rabobank; the country produces about 26% of the world\u2019s most common cooking oil. Production was already expected to drop by as much as 10% due to last year\u2019s dry weather and less aggressive fertilization. Now the labor shortage suggests the shortfall could more than double, Nageeb said, and growers are beginning to fidget. In April, top producer United Plantations Bhd. warned investors of a potential threat to production in the second half of 2020 \"as the present lockdown policy and restrictions on travel in many South East Asian countries will prevent guest workers from Indonesia, Bangladesh or India from seeking job opportunities in the Malaysian plantation industry.\u201d \u201dWe are indeed caught between a rock and a hard place as the first priority is of course to strictly adhere to the governments directives to keep Malaysia safe and Covid-19-free,\u201d Chief Executive Director Carl Bek-Nielsen said by email. That would mean the recruitment process to hire guest workers probably can\u2019t resume for the rest of the year, which would \"aggravate and exacerbate an already perilous situation for many plantation companies.\u201d Labor Squeeze Labor shortages have plagued growers for years, though never this acutely. Malaysia\u2019s plantations are now competing with higher wages offered by the growing industry in Indonesia, the world\u2019s biggest producer, and while benefits and employment practices vary, the industry has a reputation for exploitation and abuse. Automation has offered little relief. Palm fruit is fragile, growing in bunches that can weigh as much as 100 pounds, 60 feet off the ground. Most of it is still harvested by hand. Compared with soy or rapeseed, harvesting palm fruit requires 25 times more workers. The sudden and rapid outbreak of the coronavirus has turned long-term challenges into short-term ones, said Aurelia Britsch, head of commodities at Fitch Solutions. \"The sector is currently recording labor shortages, as ongoing lockdown measures mean palm oil estates are generally unable to recruit new foreign workers at a time when some employees have been repatriated to their origin countries due to the pandemic.\u201d In better times, the farmers might have raised wages to attract more workers. Not now, with global economies in free-fall and commodities prices growing more volatile. Even with a shortage of labor and, potentially, supply, the tropical oil on course for its biggest annual drop since 2012. \u201dThe reality is stark,\u201d United\u2019s Bek-Nielsen said. \"Growers are fearing that field losses will creep up from August-September towards the end of the year in tune with more and more guest workers returning home on leave. It is sadly a one-way traffic for the rest of 2020.\u201d Stopping production is an option for rubber and other crops, a way to use less labor and eat into stockpiles, forcing prices to rise. Palm isn\u2019t that flexible. \"It\u2019s not as simple as stopping production to let prices go up,\u201d said Nageeb. \"The moment you stop your production for two weeks, to bring it back to normal will take two months.\u201d Without enough workers to harvest the crop in a timely way, palm fruit will rot. The fruit that is harvested also has to be sent quickly to crushing mills or it\u2019ll start to oxidize, increasing acidity levels and reducing oil quality. Manual labor\u2019s also required to keep trees pruned and healthy for future seasons. Migrant Exodus For migrant workers, the virus outbreak and the lockdowns that followed have been been grueling. Those who left may not be able to return, losing a steady, if modest, source of income. Those that stayed faced other problems, said Glorene Das, executive director of Tenaganita, a Malaysian NGO that promotes rights of migrant workers and refugees. The government requires employers to provide workers with adequate social distance and protective gear, as well as routinely disinfected work environments. That applies to plantation operators too, but \"the remoteness of these locations and the lack of labor inspectors contribute to difficulty in enforcement,\u201d according to the International Labour Organization. During the lockdown, some plantation workers struggled to get enough food and other basic supplies. Documented and undocumented Indonesian workers are the biggest contingent among Malaysia\u2019s immigrant palm laborers. When the country imposed its nationwide lockdown, many workers on short-stay visas returned to Indonesia, said Zana Amir, program officer at Migrant Care, a Jakarta-headquartered group. \"They feared having no income in Malaysia, as the government conducted raids on illegal workers,\u201d Zana said. The labor shortages are likely to worsen, analysts predict, as governments try to combat the coronavirus-induced recession and rising unemployment. \"In Malaysia, this is likely to lead to stricter immigration regulations,\u201d said Fitch\u2019s Britsch. \"Given plantations\u2019 large reliance on foreign labor, these regulations will aggravate further the rising labor challenges palm oil companies have been facing in recent years.\u201d When and if Malaysia eases restrictions on travel or work visas, workers may not return en masse, said Oscar Tjakra, Singapore-based analyst at Rabobank. \"It will take some time for migrant workers who had left the country to travel back to Malaysia,\u201d he said. \"These migrant workers will monitor the coronavirus outbreak situation and economic situation in Malaysia before deciding to come back.\u201d - Bloomberg\n                \n                "},

For mother-of-two Aracely Mediavilla, the weekly deliveries of food and essential supplies from Barcelona-based volunteers have been a lifeline since she returned to Spain from Ecuador in the hope of getting her elder son medical treatment. \"It's not just a box of food - it's a box of love, of hope,\" said Mediavilla, fighting back tears. \"I am grateful for it because my children have been able to eat and feel loved.\" Mediavilla, 28, lived in Barcelona for years before Spain's 2008 economic crisis, and decided to return when her son Julian was diagnosed with retinopathy which blinded him in one eye. But the coronavirus lockdown, now in its 13th week, made it impossible for Mediavilla to get a job, and with a second newborn boy in tow, she and her mother Alicia rely on the help of a group of parishioners called Maria Auxiliadora, or Mary of Succour. The volunteers, who are associated to Santa Anna church in central Barcelona, gathered funds to provide Mediavilla's son Julian with special glasses. They also helped her land a job as an admnistrative assistant in a laboratory, which she began last week. On one sunny morning outside Santa Anna, the breakfast line stretched far down the street, with volunteers distributing reusable face masks to people as they queued for sacks of basic supplies and a cup of milky coffee. \"We do a breakfast, lunch and dinner service every day,\" said Peio Sanchez, priest at Santa Anna. \"This queue has been increasing, firstly because of the undocumented migrants.\" Undocumented immigrants are often precariously - and informally - employed, making them especially vulnerable to economic shocks and difficult domestic situations, Sanchez said. \"From the second month (we attended) people who had not received the corresponding aid and who no longer had the resources to pay for food and rent,\" Sanchez added. The priest expects Barcelona's homeless population - currently 1,500 - to triple in the next two years. Similar scenes have played out in Aluche, a poor neighbourhood in the capital Madrid. Spain's strict lockdown cost the economy 900,000 jobs in the second half of March alone. Last week, Spain approved an income support programme for about 2.5 million of its poorest citizens, set at about half the minimum wage of 1,108 euros $1,244.84) per month.

He said the tests, which starts on Tuesday (June 2), will also be conducted on 700 prison staff.    \"Swab tests will not be conducted on inmates residing in other blocks. This is because there is no interaction or meeting between inmates of different blocks.    \"So, there is no need for the rest to be tested,\" he said.    There are eight separate blocks at the Sungai Buloh prison.    According to reports, the prisoner, a foreigner, was detained as an undocumented worker since 2016, but left the prison on March 13 before he was found to be positive for Covid-19.    The individual has since been transferred to the Immigration depot in Semenyih.

The situation is similar to what happened in Singapore with the number of local cases going down and a spike in new cases appearing among foreign workers. Clusters of Covid-19 infections have been detected at three construction sites and three immigration depots. More than 4,000 undocumented immigrants have been detained at these depots for not possessing valid travel and work documents. As the number of cases have increased, some have started to blame foreign workers for the spread of the disease \u2013 but is it justifiable to do so?    Let us first look at the factors that work against efforts to mitigate the spread of the virus. According to the Health director-general Datuk Dr Noor Hisham Abdullah, the main factors are the workers\u2019 crowded living environment and poor hygiene practices. But migrant workers should not be the only ones blamed for such conditions. Aside from probably being uneducated about hygiene, it is very likely that the workers have no choice about living in crowded conditions because that is all they can afford on their low wages or because those are the accommodations that they have been provided by their employers.    Employers who are responsible for this should also bear some of the responsibility. The implementation of standard operating procedures (SOPs) to mitigate the spread of Covid-19 should not only be limited to worksites.    Dr Noor Hisham has called on employers to ensure that physical distancing measures at workers\u2019 accommodations are taken seriously by having beds at least 1m to 2m apart, enough space so they can avoid preparing and consuming food in large groups, and ensuring that toilets and surrounding areas are clean and sanitised.    As stated in the Workers\u2019 Minimum Standards of Housing and Amenities Act (Amended 2019) \u2013 scheduled to have taken effect on June 1, 2020, in Peninsular Malaysia and Labuan \u2013 one of the duties and responsibilities of an employer associated with the current situation is laid out under Section 24J: (f) To take preventive measures to contain the spread of infectious diseases as ordered by the Medical Officer of Health in accordance with relevant written laws, the employer shall, at his own expense, make arrangements as ordered by the Medical Officer of Health so that all or any of the employees be given immunisation against any infectious disease. Another sub-section of Section 24J that is closely related is (b) to take necessary preventive measures to ensure employees\u2019 safety and well-being. So it is actually written into law that it is the employers\u2019 obligation to take action to curb the spread of Covid-19 among their foreign workers.    The right action has been pursued by making it compulsory for foreign workers in all sectors to undergo Covid-19 screening after the rise in the number of cases at construction sites. But the screening has to go along with preventive measures that ensure the workers have appropriate accommodations where they can maintain physical distancing.    On May 28, 2020, Human Resources Minister Datuk Seri M. Saravanan announced that the government is giving employers a grace period of three months, until Aug 31, to comply with the amendments to the Workers\u2019 Minimum Standards of Housing and Amenities Act. However, the deadly nature of the pandemic that could worsen current conditions quickly should be the key reason for employers to not delay complying with the Act. The amendments were passed in Parliament in July 2019, then gazetted in September 2019, so the duration since then should have provided sufficient time for employers. Delaying compliance would be irresponsible, as the spread of Covid-19 places Malaysian citizens at risk along with foreign workers.    Furthermore, as most of the foreign workers are hired for \u201c3D jobs\u201d (dangerous, dirty and difficult), they are accustomed to and accepting of unhygienic surroundings. So awareness about the severity of the pandemic and the need for hygiene to stop the spread of the virus needs to be instilled by educating them on SOPs at worksites and their accommodations.    Although we hope this spike of Covid-19 cases in Malaysia will not be as bad as Singapore\u2019s, as noted by Universiti Malaya public health specialist Dr Rafdzah Ahmad Zaki, prompt measures must be taken because foreign workers make up 15% to 30% of Malaysia\u2019s labour force. Singapore should be a wake-up call for Malaysia, and we can learn lessons from the experience there. The enforcement of the amended Act should not be delayed as it is not only important to prevent the virus spreading widely but also for the well-being of the workers.

Malaysian Employers Federation (MEF) executive director Datuk Shamsuddin Bardan said only a small number of sectors had manpower issues for now due to strict government rules and its requirements for foreign workers. \u201cMost employers are dealing with an excess of workers now rather than a shortage following a sharp decline in the global economy due to Covid-19. \u201cThe areas where the authorities are very strict about when it comes to foreign workers are, for example, some of the wet markets and construction industry, where crackdowns have been instituted,\u201d said Shamsuddin. \u201cThe shortage of foreign workers is only limited to certain sectors, namely construction, plantation and some manufacturing sectors.\u201d He said some manufacturers might still require foreign workers, especially those producing high-demand products, such as personal protective equipment. Shamsuddin said it had been hard for the plantation sector to attract locals due to the mistaken belief that jobs in the plantation are low-class. \u201cBut if we look deeper, plantation workers are provided with proper and furnished housing, land to cultivate in, good facilities and depending on one\u2019s effort to work \u2013 only that they live away from towns and cities,\u201d he said. \u201cA worker doing harvesting work can earn more than RM2,000 a month with most of his needs provided for free but Malaysians are not interested.\u201d Shamsuddin said society needed to change their views of less-favourable jobs, such as those deemed 3D \u2013 dirty, dangerous and difficult. He said such jobs could be \u201crebranded\u201d to attract more Malaysian workers. \u201cWe need to modernise these jobs and make them more attractive. \u201cFor example, in Switzerland, only a licensed plumber can legally carry out any work on the plumbing system in a home,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is about upgrading the profession itself so that it is not seen as less attractive jobs.\u201d He said the government should upgrade the skills required for those who want to work in such sectors, which could mean more investment in training, reskilling and upskilling of existing workers. Shamsuddin noted that Malaysia had enough foreign workers for the time being, and only some of them were in the \u201cwrong sector\u201d that was less in demand now. \u201cThe government should facilitate employers to temporarily redeploy these foreign workers, place them at sectors where they are needed without having to retrench and repatriate them,\u201d he said, adding that retrenching and repatriating were rather simplistic and not helping employers to reduce cost in reviving the economy post-Covid-19. Meanwhile, Indonesia has temporarily stopped sending its domestic workers to Malaysia after the MCO was enforced here, said the embassy\u2019s Information, Social and Cultural Affairs counsellor Agung Cahaya Sumirat. \u201cIn tackling the pandemic, the Indonesian government has temporarily halted sending migrants abroad. \u201cWe will see and evaluate the matter later while considering the development of the virus outbreak,\u201d he said in an interview. Malaysia is one of the main destinations for Indonesian migrant workers. According to the embassy\u2019s official data, there are almost 800,000 Indonesian migrants registered in Malaysia. However, it is learnt that the total number including undocumented workers could be three times more than the registered number. \n                \n                "},

If you check out MAEPS, it is such a nice place and the government has spent millions of ringgit to set it up (as a Covid-19 hospital), \u201d he said.    On a related matter, Ismail Sabri, who is also Defence Minister, said 824 motorists that attempted interstate travel without permission on Tuesday were told to turn back - an increase from the 738 attempts recorded the day before.    He said the police has also detained 136 individuals, of which 75 were remanded while 61 were on bail for defying the conditional movement control order (MCO).    \u201cCompounds were also issued to 534 individuals for various offences under the conditional MCO, \u201d he said.    States that recorded the highest number of attempts to cross borders are Selangor (284), Kedah (122) and Melaka (113).    Ismail Sabri also said that audit firms that instructed their staff to work in different states were breaching the conditional MCO.    \u201cAs I have mentioned previously, interstate travels are only for emergencies such as a death or for close family members to visit those who are very ill.    \u201cAuditors wanting to check accounts of (their clients) is obviously not part of it. An audit isn\u2019t even an emergency, \u201d he said.

Its executive director Datuk Shamsuddin Bardan said the government\u2019s decision to enforce the amendment to the Workers\u2019 Minimum Standards of Housing and Amenities Act on June 1 was insensitive and did not take into account the problems faced by employers.    \u201cInstead, the government should assist employers by guiding them and workers on how Covid-19 can be prevented at their quarters.\u201d    The amendment will now include workers from all industries, including construction, with a three-month grace period granted to employers to implement it.    Shamsuddin said the minimum space requirement per worker living in a permanent dwelling is 4.8sq m while temporary dwelling is 3sq m.    \u201cThe space required for individual employees is demanding and costly and yet the maximum allowable charge on accommodation currently is only RM50 per worker, way below the centralised housing cost of RM100 to RM150 at market rate.    \u201cSome employers may have to send home some foreign workers because they don\u2019t have enough financial resources to comply with it,\u201d he said, adding that the government should target undocumented workers in which most Covid-19 cases were detected.    He also said that the grace period was too short as they were trying to cope with the requirements under the conditional movement control order to revive businesses.    Shamsuddin said providing \u201ckongsi\u201d type accommodation at construction sites would no longer be feasible under the new law.    \u201cAccommodation will be further away from construction sites and there is a need to provide transportation, which adds cost and travel time,\u201d he said.    However, Malaysian Medical Association president Dr N. Ganabaskaran welcomed the government\u2019s move, saying that workers should not be living in cramped rooms and a limit must be set on the number of workers per room.    \u201cPhysical distancing and good personal hygiene must be observed. Their accommodation must also be kept clean and disinfected,\u201d he said.    Dr Ganabaskaran said employers should also appoint team leaders to ensure preventive measures were enforced as part of the standard operating procedure (SOP).    \u201cRegular checks at construction sites and foreign workers\u2019 accommodation should be conducted by the authorities,\u201d he said, adding that fines should be issued for non-compliance.

Federation of Malaysian Manufacturers (FMM) president Tan Sri Soh Thian Lai said the amendments to the Minimum Standards of Housing and Amenities (Amendment) Act was a good decision in the long term as it would ensure conducive housing condition for all workers, and enhance the health and productivity of the workforce in the country.    However, Soh said the amendments, which would come into force on June 1 in Peninsular Malaysia and the Federal Territory of Labuan, could pose some challenges to fulfilling them.    The Human Resources Ministry said the government would give a three-month grace period until Aug 31 to give room for employers to make the necessary arrangements.    The enforcement under the Act will begin on Sept 1. The amendments to the Act was passed in Parliament last July and was gazetted on Sept 18.    \u201cBut with the huge number of foreign workers in Malaysia, around two million documented and about four million undocumented, it could pose a big challenge to fulfil conditions under the amendments of the Act within 15 months, including the three-month grace period as all affected employers who employ foreign workers must comply with it, \u201d said Soh.    \u201cNow that the highest risk clusters of Covid-19 infections are foreign workers, this Act is timely \u2013 but it\u2019s too short a time to get the employers prepared.    \u201cWe urge the authorities to give more time, at least six months, for companies to reset and rearrange according to the standard operating procedure (SOP), \u201d Soh said.    Soh said the government should now focus on the construction sites and quarters of foreign workers in the yellow and red zones as they were the high-risk clusters.    \u201cThe most important thing is for all companies with foreign workers to follow the SOP set by the Health Ministry and authorities to minimise the risks, \u201d he said.    Master Builders Association of Malaysia (MBAM) president Foo Chek Lee said it was in full support of the implementation of the amendment, which it helped to draft years ago.    \u201cA worker needs a good place to stay and rest.    \u201cIf they don\u2019t have proper rest, they can\u2019t work and if their living condition is not good, they will get sick and it affects productivity, \u201d he said.    Foo said big construction companies would not have problems to provide housing according to the guidelines.    He pointed out that some workers, however, were labourers who did not have permanent employment and chose to live in cramped conditions to save money.    \u201cThe main contractor and project owners are liable to provide proper accommodation to foreign workers.    \u201cHowever, some sub-contractors may still resort to providing housing in the form of kongsi or hostel but now they would have to follow the guidelines under the amendments, \u201d he said.    Foo, however, said the grace period was tight as it did not give much time for companies to prepare.    \u201cBut this is an extraordinary time with Covid-19, so companies will have to push and make it happen to safeguard public health, \u201d Foo added.    Real Estate and Housing Developers Association (Rehda) national council member Tony Khoo Boon Chuan said there was confusion on the ground as the detailed SOP was not available.    When asked on the ramification of the amendments, Khoo said the extra cost from providing housing, according to guidelines, would be transferred to home buyers eventually.    \u201cThis will result in more expensive houses and properties, \u201d he said.    Bina Puri Holdings group executive director Matthew Tee said although the amendments came at a cost, the industry would have to manage it.    \u201cWe try to follow the guidelines but all these implementations come at a cost, at a time when the construction sector is undergoing a recession, \u201d said Tee. \n                \n                "},

Instead, Aegile Fernandez \u2013 who has 37 years of experience in immigration and human-trafficking issues \u2013 said the government should work with NGOs, civil society and employers to educate migrant workers about the pandemic.    \u201cIf the undocumented foreign workers are treated with kindness, they will seek treatment if they are ill, \u201d she said.    Early this week, most of the Covid-19 clusters were discovered at three immigration detention depots and centres (DTIs) in Sepang, Bukit Jalil and Semenyih.    Health director-general Datuk Dr Noor Hisham Abdullah said that of the 172 cases tested positive in the country on Monday, 112 were from the DTIs.    The next day, 173 foreigners tested positive. Thirteen were security guards from Cheras.    The spike in cases, three-digit figures since May 3, has the public concerned but Dr Noor Hisham assured everyone that the DTIs were in isolated areas and under control by local authorities.    On the same day, Senior Minister Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri Yaakob said the government would send DTI detainees to Covid-19 makeshift hospitals and deport those who were free of Covid-19.    Infectious disease consultant Datuk Dr Christopher Lee concurred with Aegile.    \u201cIf we feel they are a major risk group based on their close living conditions, then we need to engage them rather than make them hide from the authorities, \u201d he said.    Dr Lee also said that if the undocumented workers had acquired the infection inside the camps, then the authorities needed to sort out the hygiene and social distancing issues there although it would pose a challenge due to the huge numbers.    \u201cEthically, we still have to try our best to minimise the risks, \u201d he said.    Universiti Malaya senior research consultant academician Emeritus Prof Datuk Dr Lam Sai Kit also said the Immigration Department should not detain undocumented migrants at this stage to prevent overcrowding.    \u201cDetainees should be educated on how the virus is spread and about personal hygiene, including wearing of face masks, \u201d he said.    However, consultant public health physician Datuk Lokman Hakim Sulaiman agreed with the authorities that detaining undocumented workers would help minimise Covid-19\u2019s spread to the general public and those tested negative should be deported.    \u201cWho will foot their bill if all undocumented workers are required to be tested?\u201d he said. \n                \n                "},

Shoplots, roadside stalls and outlets operating inside complexes were also raided by Kuala Lumpur City Hall (DBKL) enforcement officers and sealed with yellow tape as a warning to those who break the law.    Kuala Lumpur mayor Datuk Nor Hisham Ahmad Dahlan said the blitz was carried out following enforcement officers\u2019 investigation as well as tip-off from business owners and the public.    He said dozens of foreigners were undocumented and were operating using expired or illegal work permits or using licence that was sublet to them by Malaysians.    The businesses range from restaurants, sundry shops, fruit and vegetable stalls to tailoring business, car wash and telephone accessories shops.    It was learnt that residents raised concerns about the illegal businesses that were contributing to pollution and overcrowding in various locations across Kuala Lumpur.

Tan said since they could resume work when the conditional movement control order (MCO) came into effect, he ensured social distancing was practised at the workplace.\u201cWe are working at a slower pace and I do not bring all my workers to the site at once, \u2019\u2019 said Tan, adding that he has also sent all his workers for Covid-19 testing.    The workers\u2019 temperatures were taken and recorded every morning before they go to the worksite.    Meanwhile, state investment, industry and trade, small and medium industries committee chairman Datuk Teng Chang Khim said the Selangor government was helping the Health Ministry in its efforts to detect and curb Covid-19 infection among construction workers.    \u201cThe state cannot take the lead on this matter and thus we are doing everything possible to complement the initiatives taken by the ministry, \u2019\u2019 said Teng.    This included having a budget to go towards carrying out screening of construction workers and providing whatever else was required by the Health Ministry.    \u201cFor instance, if the ministry has insufficient personal protective gears, we will provide them with these, \u2019\u2019 said Teng, adding that the Health Ministry was doing the right thing to stem Covid-19 cases in the construction industry.    Teng said sending home undocumented workers who were Covid-19 negative as well as random testing was the only viable option at the moment.    Meanwhile, state health, welfare, women empowerment and family committee chairman Dr Siti Mariah Mahmud said RM2.06mil has been allocated by the Selangor government for screening of high risk groups.    \u201cWe\u2019ll be having a meeting with Mentri Besar Datuk Seri Amirudin Shari, the state health department as well as Selangor Task Force for Covid-19 on June 1 to determine all the high risk groups for screening, \u2019\u2019 said Dr Siti Mariah.    She added that PPEs were also being produced by the state\u2019s Women Development Centre in collaboration with Hospital Banting.    In Sabah, things are rough. Many construction sites are not running due to employers\u2019 inability to get their workers tested for Covid-19.    Sabah Builders Association (SBA) president Lou Chi Nam said that feedback from SBA\u2019s 100-odd members was that most of them would not begin work until June \u2013 and if the conditional MCO were to be over.\u201cOne of the requirements to start operating is that these workers must have gotten tested for the virus and results obtained, \u201d he said. \u201cBut since many are not able to, mainly due to the cost, they cannot operate, \u201d he said.    Lou said those who could afford to pay for their workers\u2019 swab tests also had to wait for a long period as there was a limit to the number of tests health officials could conduct in a day. \n                \n                "},

South Korea\u2019s Centre for Disease Control and Prevention on Tuesday (May 26) also reported two more deaths, bringing national totals to 11,225 and 269 fatalities. Officials linked three of the new cases to international arrivals. South Korea has been reporting around 20 new cases per day over the past two weeks after health workers found hundreds of infections linked to clubgoers who went out in early May as the country eased on social distancing. The caseload has slowed from early March when it was reporting hundreds of new cases a day, but the new infections in the greater capital area has caused concern as authorities proceed with a phased reopening of schools, which began with high school seniors last week. Around 2.4 million high school juniors, middle school seniors, first- and second-grade elementary school children and kindergartners will be returning to school on Wednesday. Health Minister Park Neung-hoo during a virus meeting urged school officials to double-check their preventive measures. He called for authorities to strengthen monitoring on some 390,000 undocumented foreign nationals who may have poor access to medical services and tests, but related measures weren\u2019t immediately announced. South Korea also Tuesday began requiring people to wear masks on public transit and while using taxis. People in South Korea, like in much of Asia, have generally worn masks in public settings and no major disruptions were reported. Health authorities have left mask enforcement to bus drivers and subway station workers. Taxi drivers are allowed to refuse picking up passengers if they aren\u2019t wearing masks. South Korea since March has banned the exports of masks and channelled most domestically produced masks to pharmacies, where people are currently limited to buying three masks per week. The nationwide rationing was a drastic attempt at calming public anger over shortages, but supply has stabilised. - AP\n                \n                "},

The Malaysian authorities have swept up hundreds of undocumented workers in raids amid its movement control order, while its neighbour Indonesia, home to most of them, is repatriating its citizens. Just as Singapore has struggled to deal with a coronavirus outbreak that spread quickly through its population of foreign workers in dormitories, countries with large numbers of low-wage migrant workers are grappling with similar issues. From Asia to the Middle East, the Covid-19 (coronavirus) pandemic is exposing the unique vulnerabilities of the world's estimated 164 million low-paid migrant workers, who toil at the jobs locals do not want, to save money and get a leg up back home. While some appear to have escaped the same sort of outbreak Singapore is dealing with, activists say good examples of how to manage this segment of their population are few and far between. As Covid-19 takes its toll on economies and public health in many countries, low-wage migrant worker populations have largely been affected disproportionately. Observers say problems include poor living conditions, insufficient legal protection and limited access to healthcare. Last month, Saudi Arabia had shipped home nearly 3,000 of the estimated 200,000 Ethiopians living there before the United Nations called for a halt. In Kuwait last month, at least a dozen migrant workers took their own lives or attempted to, according to migrant-rights.org, an activist website, citing media reports. In Thailand, hundreds of thousands of workers from neighbouring countries like Myanmar, Laos and Cambodia are said to have fled home after a lockdown left them with the prospect of being stuck without money or food. n Malaysia, police rounded up 200 undocumented workers last week alone in Petaling Jaya, outside Kuala Lumpur, even as officials gradually ease movement restrictions. The country is thought to have at least five million migrant workers. Indonesia, one of the world's biggest contributors of labour, has repatriated more than 130,000 of its citizens working abroad as construction workers, cruise ship staff and housekeepers, as well as students. David Welsh, country director of the South-East Asia branch of the Solidarity Centre, a non-profit organisation aligned with the United States-based labour federation AFL-CIO, said the crisis has exposed the poor conditions many migrant workers face. \"Migrant workers have been left aside by governments who have relied on them to do dangerous jobs that have become even more dangerous during this crisis,\" Welsh said. Then, there is Qatar, where observers say criticism of the country's treatment of migrant labour in the wake of its successful bid to host the Fifa World Cup in 2022 has sparked changes that are a lesson to others but also a demonstration of how difficult the process is going to be. Like in Singapore, the outbreak in Qatar has centred on its foreign workers, who outnumber Qataris in the workforce by nearly 20 to one. Total infections have ticked past 40,000 in a country with 2.8 million people. Last October, it abolished exit visas for departing workers and did away with discriminatory laws assigning minimum wages by nationality. The monarchy at the same time abolished the sponsorship rules that tie workers to jobs and make them vulnerable to abuse. The country's new minimum wage laws also override bilateral agreements with countries of origin that can see a Bangladeshi welder, for example, earning two-thirds what a Filipino might. Qatar's ambition to host the World Cup has helped prompt the changes. Shortly after securing the event a decade ago, Qatar publicly promised four weeks' paid leave, overtime and other benefits to workers employed by the contractors awarded work. Contractors erecting more than half a dozen stadiums and other needed infrastructure offer workers attractive terms that meet the scrutiny of activists and unions. Apolinar Tolentino, regional representative for the Building and Wood Workers' International Asia-Pacific, said his union has had regular access to inspect work sites and dormitories where workers are housed four to an air-conditioned room and bunk beds are banned. The visits included group interviews with workers to assess conditions including health and safety, food quality and even Internet speeds. \"Qatar is setting an example in the region of how to treat its migrant labour,\" said Tolentino. But he acknowledges that the improvement has not been even. Earlier this month, the government began easing a two-month lockdown of the sprawling Industrial Area outside of Doha, where hundreds of thousands of workers were holed up in dormitories. The government requires all employers to pay furloughed workers, but there have been reports of workers stranded and begging for food. The problem is fuelled in part by undocumented foreign workers relying on short-term casual work, who do not have regular employers. \"Compliance with standards outside the World Cup projects are more challenging,\" Tolentino said. \"There is almost no direct access by international organisations.\" Last month, Amnesty International and a coalition of non-governmental organisations and trade unions sent letters to Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Bahrain, Kuwait and Oman, raising concerns about migrant workers. Amnesty International's Middle East research director Lynn Maalouf said: \"While some governments made promising commitments to support migrant workers, much more needs to be done to ensure Covid-19 will not result in further human rights violations and greater suffering for migrant workers in these countries.\" - The Straits Times/Asian News Network\n                \n                "},

The Deputy Tourism, Arts and Culture Minister said this forum was aimed at engaging stakeholders and the public to gather feedback and find solutions to resolve the problem of illegal immigrants, particularly in Sabah.    \u201cThe Covid-19 pandemic has in a way created an unprecedented opportunity in highlighting the presence of the millions of illegal and unlawful foreigners in Malaysia,\u201d Jeffrey said in a statement here on Tuesday (May 26).    He cited as examples various news reports over the arrests of illegal immigrants in Sabah as well as reports of attempted entry by Rohingya in Langkawi and north-western Peninsular Malaysia.    Jeffrey said illegal immigrants and undocumented foreigners in Malaysia had been receiving much media coverage and causing social media anger from netizens recently.    \u201cThese foreigners and illegals pose a huge threat, not just because of the Covid-19 infections and social problems. A long-term sustainable solution needs to be put in place,\u201d Jeffrey said.    He said the time has come for concerted efforts by all stakeholders and connected parties to sit down and work out a holistic long-term plan to deal with illegal immigrants and undocumented persons in Malaysia.    He said he has nothing against legal foreigners entering Sabah via proper means, but not through backdoor routes.    \u201cBy all means, they are welcome in Malaysia - but it must be through the proper immigration channels with proper documentation from their home countries,\u201d Jeffrey said.    He said now that STAR Sabah is in the Federal Government, it is appropriate that they initiate a forum to find the way forward for an all-encompassing solution for this issue in Malaysia, particularly in Sabah. \n                \n                "},

The Senior Minister (Security) said the decision was made at a meeting on Tuesday (May 26) morning between the various ministries and departments involved including the Home Ministry.    He said they would get the assistance of the various embassies to deport the undocumented migrants.    \u201cThey will undergo screening before they are deported.

At a press conference held on May 22, Senior Minister Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri Yaakob stated that the 60 confirmed positive cases in Bukit Jalil have been in the centre before the movement control order (MCO) took effect on March 18, and that all 114 of the Immigration officers on duty have tested negative.    While the government has stated that it will be screening detainees, testing alone is not a foolproof measure of preventing the spread of the virus. If the testing is only done once, there is no guarantee that the person would be free from infection, as the infected person may test negative because the test is unable to detect new exposure to infection within five days.    We are aware that three weeks are sufficient to trigger two to three generations of the spread of the virus. Given the pre-existing cramped conditions in the centres and the pressure that will be placed on the infrastructure with more detainees being brought in, we have grave concerns regarding the government\u2019s ability to prevent the transmission of disease.    Contrary to prevailing logic, the government\u2019s punitive approach toward undocumented migrant workers and refugees during this time of crisis poses a public health risk \u2013 for example, some individuals attempted escape from enhanced MCO areas. It also hurts the local economy as many sectors do rely on such workers for their day-to-day operations. It further puts Immigration officers at grave risk of contracting the disease and transmitting it to their family members.    Regrettably, the arrests of undocumented migrant workers by the government at this time has also had another inadvertent impact: It has made immigrant communities distrustful of the health system. This erodes the tremendous efforts made by the Health Ministry to combat this pandemic.    Civil society groups worked hard to be the bridge between immigrant communities and the government to build trust in the health system, which is critical to controlling this outbreak. Upon assurances from the Health Ministry in the early days of the pandemic, they encouraged immigrant and refugee communities to come out for Covid-19 screening voluntarily and without fear. Although non-citizens and the trust they place in a country\u2019s health system may not appear to be a matter of importance from a legal point of view, it is critical from a public health perspective in arresting the spread of disease. Non-health-related ministries need to understand the importance of respecting public health principles while we are in the midst of an outbreak of a disease that has no proven treatment, and that relies critically on prevention of disease transmission to stop spreading.    In this connection, the government must remember that as a member of the global community, the United Nations and the World Health Organisation, it has a higher duty of care towards incarcerated people as well as an obligation to control the spread of the pandemic regionally and globally. The detection of Covid-19 in deported immigrants, as in the case of the immigrants from Myanmar, does not augur well for Malaysia\u2019s international reputation. This is the time for nations to show solidarity and support for battling what is a global pandemic.    Finally, it cannot be over-emphasised that taking care and monitoring the health of large immigrant communities in the country is a way to also protect co-existing local communities.    As such we urgently call upon the government to:    >  Immediately stop the arrests of undocumented immigrants, refugees and asylum seekers as well as stateless persons without documents.    >  Allow the Health Ministry to take the lead in efforts to control the spread of Covid-19, including among non-citizens, and support the ministry in its efforts to combat the pandemic.    >  Invite Suhakam (the Human Rights Commission of Malaysia) to undertake a monitoring visit to detention centres to provide an independent report of the events leading to the detection of Covid-19 cases in them, and to ensure that strong preventive measures are being taken to control disease transmission in the centres.    >  Cooperate with international agencies and civil society organisations to increase detainees\u2019 access to hygiene products and other necessary supplies and to allow the UN High Commission on Refugees to identify and register Persons of Concern.    >  Develop a coherent and rational migration policy framework that links with an effective blueprint of the country\u2019s human resources needs.    >  Preserve the rule of law by taking action against xenophobic hate speech against immigrant communities whose contributions over the years have built this country.

For many of us who observe Ramadan, it is always our hope and desire that we are able to observe this special month in the Islamic calendar as meaningfully as possible and that our good deeds are accepted and our sins forgiven. Ramadan was of course not just a time for fasting but also a time for sacrifice, which we saw plenty of from many of my colleagues and other frontliners who stepped up to be a part of the nation\u2019s Covid-19 response whether directly or indirectly.    It made me especially proud to belong to the public health sector as everybody rallied and worked tirelessly to ensure that we provided the best and safest care to all of our patients while ensuring that we remained safe ourselves. The spectre of getting infected ourselves was real, as we learned of the thousands of healthcare workers who had become infected with Covid-19 and the hundreds who have died from it around the world. But for most of us this is our duty, this was what we had signed up to when we gained the right to call ourselves \u201cdoctor\u201d.    Without a doubt we can be proud of Malaysia\u2019s timely actions and achievements in the country\u2019s response to the Covid-19 threat. Health director-general Datuk Dr Noor Hisham Abdullah and his entire team deserve all the accolades they have received for keeping the level of infection under control, albeit at not an inconsiderable cost.    Despite the intense international effort in search of an effective vaccine, it will still be at least a good 18 months away before any comes into wide use. Given that the pandemic is not going to be going away anytime soon, for us frontliners the challenge will be to maintain these high standards of care and service delivery while adhering to physical distancing and infection control procedures in the long foreseeable future.    Ramadan was also a time for self-reflection, a time and opportunity to reflect on what the pandemic has meant to us as individuals and what it means to our society as a whole. Beyond the inconvenience of the movement control order (MCO) and the fear and anxiety of getting infected, I am sure Covid-19 has meant different things to different people. It has certainly taught me a lot of lessons and made me reflect deeply on what is important and what matters less so. It is a humbling experience to live through this pandemic and see how a 125nm particle has brought the whole world to its knees. From the original epicentre in Wuhan, China, to the wealthy Italian region of Lombardy to bustling New York City, no country has been spared as these little particles found their way across the world and infected more than five million people and killed over 300 000 people in just five short months. The tragedy of this pandemic will one day not only be counted in the number infected and the lives lost but also in how quickly and effectively governments and leaders responded as the epidemic unfolded.    Much has been said about the Covid-19 pandemic bringing to the fore inequalities and divisions in society. It is encouraging that the previously deafening, divisive racial rhetoric in our country has been somewhat muted throughout this epidemic \u2013 though, unfortunately, that has been replaced by the demonisation of foreign workers and undocumented immigrants. Just like the HIV epidemic before it, the Covid-19 pandemic hits especially hard those already vulnerable and marginalised by society. While some of us moan about MCO period restrictions, to many there MCO has meant a loss of income and, to some, even a loss of basic dignity. \u201cWe may be in the same storm, but not all of us are in the same boat\u201d is a saying that vividly captures the inequality that has deepened through this crisis.    We still have many more months of the pandemic to live through and the report card is still out. At this stage we seem to have passed the epidemic control test but as we move forward, the question is will we pass the bigger test? Will we take stock and learn from the devastation of Covid-19 and move towards a more compassionate, mutually respectful, inclusive, equal and just society? Will we continue to close a blind eye to the destruction of the environment in the name of profit and greed? Will we permit science and evidence to inform and guide our policies or will we continue to allow ideology and self-interest to rule?    As a woman of science I try and keep pace with the unprecedented speed and volume of the scientific knowledge on SARS-CoV-2 and use it to inform and improve patient care as well as public health policies. As a woman of faith, I cannot help but feel that Allah swt has unleashed these 125nm particles upon us to make us stop, reflect, learn and find ways in which we can make ourselves and this world a better place, for ourselves and the people we will one day leave it to, our children and their children after them. As a Muslim, there could not have been a better time to do so than the Ramadan just passed.

If they test negative for Covid-19, we will deport them.    \u201cIt is not nice to accuse Malaysia of mistreatment. In fact, other countries treat them (undocumented migrants) worse. There is no need for politicians or NGOs to act as heroes for undocumented migrants, \u201d he said.

Malaysia\u2019s economy relies on palm oil, its most important agricultural commodity, but palm oil needs migrant workers from Indonesia, Bangladesh and India to do jobs locals won\u2019t. As countries in South-East Asia struggle to get the Covid-19 outbreak under control, governments have tightened restrictions on travel for workers both coming and going. \"In the past, when people left, people also came,\u201d said Nageeb Wahab, chief executive at the Malaysian Palm Oil Association, a growers\u2019 group that represents 40% of palm plantations by area. \"Now, the coming is nil, and the leaving may be more after Malaysia\u2019s movement control order.\u201d Though environmental activists have pushed to rein in the palm industry for years, the labor shortage there signals the disruption unfolding at companies and farms around the world that depend on migrant workers. More than 70% of the country\u2019s plantation workers come from outside Malaysia\u2019s borders, according to an estimate by Rabobank; the country produces about 26% of the world\u2019s most common cooking oil. Production was already expected to drop by as much as 10% due to last year\u2019s dry weather and less aggressive fertilization. Now the labor shortage suggests the shortfall could more than double, Nageeb said, and growers are beginning to fidget. In April, top producer United Plantations Bhd. warned investors of a potential threat to production in the second half of 2020 \"as the present lockdown policy and restrictions on travel in many South East Asian countries will prevent guest workers from Indonesia, Bangladesh or India from seeking job opportunities in the Malaysian plantation industry.\u201d \u201dWe are indeed caught between a rock and a hard place as the first priority is of course to strictly adhere to the governments directives to keep Malaysia safe and Covid-19-free,\u201d Chief Executive Director Carl Bek-Nielsen said by email. That would mean the recruitment process to hire guest workers probably can\u2019t resume for the rest of the year, which would \"aggravate and exacerbate an already perilous situation for many plantation companies.\u201d Labor Squeeze Labor shortages have plagued growers for years, though never this acutely. Malaysia\u2019s plantations are now competing with higher wages offered by the growing industry in Indonesia, the world\u2019s biggest producer, and while benefits and employment practices vary, the industry has a reputation for exploitation and abuse. Automation has offered little relief. Palm fruit is fragile, growing in bunches that can weigh as much as 100 pounds, 60 feet off the ground. Most of it is still harvested by hand. Compared with soy or rapeseed, harvesting palm fruit requires 25 times more workers. The sudden and rapid outbreak of the coronavirus has turned long-term challenges into short-term ones, said Aurelia Britsch, head of commodities at Fitch Solutions. \"The sector is currently recording labor shortages, as ongoing lockdown measures mean palm oil estates are generally unable to recruit new foreign workers at a time when some employees have been repatriated to their origin countries due to the pandemic.\u201d In better times, the farmers might have raised wages to attract more workers. Not now, with global economies in free-fall and commodities prices growing more volatile. Even with a shortage of labor and, potentially, supply, the tropical oil on course for its biggest annual drop since 2012. \u201dThe reality is stark,\u201d United\u2019s Bek-Nielsen said. \"Growers are fearing that field losses will creep up from August-September towards the end of the year in tune with more and more guest workers returning home on leave. It is sadly a one-way traffic for the rest of 2020.\u201d Stopping production is an option for rubber and other crops, a way to use less labor and eat into stockpiles, forcing prices to rise. Palm isn\u2019t that flexible. \"It\u2019s not as simple as stopping production to let prices go up,\u201d said Nageeb. \"The moment you stop your production for two weeks, to bring it back to normal will take two months.\u201d Without enough workers to harvest the crop in a timely way, palm fruit will rot. The fruit that is harvested also has to be sent quickly to crushing mills or it\u2019ll start to oxidize, increasing acidity levels and reducing oil quality. Manual labor\u2019s also required to keep trees pruned and healthy for future seasons. Migrant Exodus For migrant workers, the virus outbreak and the lockdowns that followed have been been grueling. Those who left may not be able to return, losing a steady, if modest, source of income. Those that stayed faced other problems, said Glorene Das, executive director of Tenaganita, a Malaysian NGO that promotes rights of migrant workers and refugees. The government requires employers to provide workers with adequate social distance and protective gear, as well as routinely disinfected work environments. That applies to plantation operators too, but \"the remoteness of these locations and the lack of labor inspectors contribute to difficulty in enforcement,\u201d according to the International Labour Organization. During the lockdown, some plantation workers struggled to get enough food and other basic supplies. Documented and undocumented Indonesian workers are the biggest contingent among Malaysia\u2019s immigrant palm laborers. When the country imposed its nationwide lockdown, many workers on short-stay visas returned to Indonesia, said Zana Amir, program officer at Migrant Care, a Jakarta-headquartered group. \"They feared having no income in Malaysia, as the government conducted raids on illegal workers,\u201d Zana said. The labor shortages are likely to worsen, analysts predict, as governments try to combat the coronavirus-induced recession and rising unemployment. \"In Malaysia, this is likely to lead to stricter immigration regulations,\u201d said Fitch\u2019s Britsch. \"Given plantations\u2019 large reliance on foreign labor, these regulations will aggravate further the rising labor challenges palm oil companies have been facing in recent years.\u201d When and if Malaysia eases restrictions on travel or work visas, workers may not return en masse, said Oscar Tjakra, Singapore-based analyst at Rabobank. \"It will take some time for migrant workers who had left the country to travel back to Malaysia,\u201d he said. \"These migrant workers will monitor the coronavirus outbreak situation and economic situation in Malaysia before deciding to come back.\u201d - Bloomberg\n                \n                "},
{"title": "\n            Appropriate living conditions are essential for the migrant workers\n        ", "region": "Letters\n                        ", "date": 0, "text": "\n                 \n                                                \n                 Malaysians recently have been worried by news of a spike in Covid-19 infections among foreign workers. The situation is similar to what happened in Singapore with the number of local cases going down and a spike in new cases appearing among foreign workers. Clusters of Covid-19 infections have been detected at three construction sites and three immigration depots. More than 4,000 undocumented immigrants have been detained at these depots for not possessing valid travel and work documents. As the number of cases have increased, some have started to blame foreign workers for the spread of the disease \u2013 but is it justifiable to do so?    Let us first look at the factors that work against efforts to mitigate the spread of the virus. According to the Health director-general Datuk Dr Noor Hisham Abdullah, the main factors are the workers\u2019 crowded living environment and poor hygiene practices. But migrant workers should not be the only ones blamed for such conditions. Aside from probably being uneducated about hygiene, it is very likely that the workers have no choice about living in crowded conditions because that is all they can afford on their low wages or because those are the accommodations that they have been provided by their employers.    Employers who are responsible for this should also bear some of the responsibility. The implementation of standard operating procedures (SOPs) to mitigate the spread of Covid-19 should not only be limited to worksites.    Dr Noor Hisham has called on employers to ensure that physical distancing measures at workers\u2019 accommodations are taken seriously by having beds at least 1m to 2m apart, enough space so they can avoid preparing and consuming food in large groups, and ensuring that toilets and surrounding areas are clean and sanitised.    As stated in the Workers\u2019 Minimum Standards of Housing and Amenities Act (Amended 2019) \u2013 scheduled to have taken effect on June 1, 2020, in Peninsular Malaysia and Labuan \u2013 one of the duties and responsibilities of an employer associated with the current situation is laid out under Section 24J: (f) To take preventive measures to contain the spread of infectious diseases as ordered by the Medical Officer of Health in accordance with relevant written laws, the employer shall, at his own expense, make arrangements as ordered by the Medical Officer of Health so that all or any of the employees be given immunisation against any infectious disease. Another sub-section of Section 24J that is closely related is (b) to take necessary preventive measures to ensure employees\u2019 safety and well-being. So it is actually written into law that it is the employers\u2019 obligation to take action to curb the spread of Covid-19 among their foreign workers.    The right action has been pursued by making it compulsory for foreign workers in all sectors to undergo Covid-19 screening after the rise in the number of cases at construction sites. But the screening has to go along with preventive measures that ensure the workers have appropriate accommodations where they can maintain physical distancing.    On May 28, 2020, Human Resources Minister Datuk Seri M. Saravanan announced that the government is giving employers a grace period of three months, until Aug 31, to comply with the amendments to the Workers\u2019 Minimum Standards of Housing and Amenities Act. However, the deadly nature of the pandemic that could worsen current conditions quickly should be the key reason for employers to not delay complying with the Act. The amendments were passed in Parliament in July 2019, then gazetted in September 2019, so the duration since then should have provided sufficient time for employers. Delaying compliance would be irresponsible, as the spread of Covid-19 places Malaysian citizens at risk along with foreign workers.    Furthermore, as most of the foreign workers are hired for \u201c3D jobs\u201d (dangerous, dirty and difficult), they are accustomed to and accepting of unhygienic surroundings. So awareness about the severity of the pandemic and the need for hygiene to stop the spread of the virus needs to be instilled by educating them on SOPs at worksites and their accommodations.    Although we hope this spike of Covid-19 cases in Malaysia will not be as bad as Singapore\u2019s, as noted by Universiti Malaya public health specialist Dr Rafdzah Ahmad Zaki, prompt measures must be taken because foreign workers make up 15% to 30% of Malaysia\u2019s labour force. Singapore should be a wake-up call for Malaysia, and we can learn lessons from the experience there. The enforcement of the amended Act should not be delayed as it is not only important to prevent the virus spreading widely but also for the well-being of the workers.

For mother-of-two Aracely Mediavilla, the weekly deliveries of food and essential supplies from Barcelona-based volunteers have been a lifeline since she returned to Spain from Ecuador in the hope of getting her elder son medical treatment. \"It's not just a box of food - it's a box of love, of hope,\" said Mediavilla, fighting back tears. \"I am grateful for it because my children have been able to eat and feel loved.\" Mediavilla, 28, lived in Barcelona for years before Spain's 2008 economic crisis, and decided to return when her son Julian was diagnosed with retinopathy which blinded him in one eye. But the coronavirus lockdown, now in its 13th week, made it impossible for Mediavilla to get a job, and with a second newborn boy in tow, she and her mother Alicia rely on the help of a group of parishioners called Maria Auxiliadora, or Mary of Succour. The volunteers, who are associated to Santa Anna church in central Barcelona, gathered funds to provide Mediavilla's son Julian with special glasses. They also helped her land a job as an admnistrative assistant in a laboratory, which she began last week. On one sunny morning outside Santa Anna, the breakfast line stretched far down the street, with volunteers distributing reusable face masks to people as they queued for sacks of basic supplies and a cup of milky coffee. \"We do a breakfast, lunch and dinner service every day,\" said Peio Sanchez, priest at Santa Anna. \"This queue has been increasing, firstly because of the undocumented migrants.\" Undocumented immigrants are often precariously - and informally - employed, making them especially vulnerable to economic shocks and difficult domestic situations, Sanchez said. \"From the second month (we attended) people who had not received the corresponding aid and who no longer had the resources to pay for food and rent,\" Sanchez added. The priest expects Barcelona's homeless population - currently 1,500 - to triple in the next two years. Similar scenes have played out in Aluche, a poor neighbourhood in the capital Madrid. Spain's strict lockdown cost the economy 900,000 jobs in the second half of March alone. Last week, Spain approved an income support programme for about 2.5 million of its poorest citizens, set at about half the minimum wage of 1,108 euros $1,244.84) per month.

The government will also launch next year the 12th Malaysia Plan (2021-2025), which will outline the medium and longer term policies for achieving our nation's development goals and provide the public sector expenditure programme to implement such policies.    In carrying out its development plans for economic and social progress, the government must place more focus on the human aspects of development to empower the people to face the challenges that lie ahead, such as a second round of the pandemic and the uncertainties arising from the geo-political tensions around the world.    We will have to increasingly rely on our own domestic strength to remain resilient against the adverse external developments. Hence, our development plans must place greater attention on improving the quality of the education and training system to create the internal capacity for growth and prosperity. They should equip school leavers and graduates with a stronger foundation to learn new skills.    Employers prefer to recruit job applicants who are trainable to raise their productivity and technical skills. New entrants to the labour market who are good in Maths, Science and English and who impress employers with their confident personality will find it easier to get the better paid jobs.    Those whose parents can afford to send their children for private tuition in Maths, Science, languages, music and art tend to have the advantage in having these superior qualities in them. There is a growing number of children who go to expensive private schools locally and abroad. These are the children of privileged families, political and corporate elites and the middle class.    This division of success in finding good jobs between income classes is not healthy for national unity. The national education system should therefore introduce reforms to provide the quality required in the employment market. Education should be free from racial, religious and communal politics to allow reforms to be successfully implemented so that all youths will have a level playing field in life.    In general, wage levels in Malaysia are low relative to its per capita GDP and standard of development. The main reason is the weak labour policies on employment and lack of controls on importing foreign workers. Irresponsible employers are taking advantage of undocumented workers, who out-number their legal counterparts, to suppress wage levels and ignore workers rights across all segments of the labour market. The culture of low wages spreads to all levels of employment, including executives. The result is that the share of wages in national income in Malaysia is low by international standards, thus indicating an imbalance in the distribution of the country\u2019s wealth between owners of capital and the working class.    Depressed wage levels explain much of the hardships among households living in the major urban centres. In addition, urban households struggle with the higher cost of living in cities compared to the rest of the country.    As our planners work on policies for the recovery of the economy and its long-term growth, they would prioritise projects that have a high impact on generating employment and income opportunities. This is to be expected as GDP growth is essential to lift up income levels.    At the same time, our planning agencies should also strengthen the education and labour policies to make them more dynamic in providing our working population with better wages and a higher share of the national income.    With higher levels of skills, the talent pool will be enhanced and facilitate Malaysia\u2019s efforts to attract more local and foreign investment into high technology and state-of-the-art industries, as the East Asian Tigers have done to restructure their economy and    become so advanced in their standards of living. They placed high priority on investing in their human resources to transform into high income countries within a short period of one generation.

Afghanistan's foreign ministry said in a statement on Friday three Afghans were killed and four injured in Iran's central Yazd province after their vehicle was shot at by Iranian police, triggering the fire.  Video footage posted on social media showed a boy escaping from the blazing car with burns on parts of his body and begging for water. The ministry said the video was genuine and Afghans in Iran were trying to identify the victims. The boy's plea of \"give me some water, I am burning\" was widely circulated on social media and taken up by rights group demanding justice. \"Iran has no right to kill Afghan refugees, they can seal their borders, expel all Afghans but not kill them,\" said Ali Noori, a lawyer and rights activist said on Facebook. Afghans have for decades sought refuge in Iran from war and poverty in their homeland. Iran says about 2.5 million Afghan migrants, both legal and undocumented, live there. Facing its own economic problems worsened by international sanctions, Iran has at times tried to send Afghans home. Last month, Afghan officials said Iranian border guards killed 45 Afghan migrant workers by forcing them at gunpoint into a mountain torrent on the border. At the time, Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi issued a statement saying only that the incident in question had taken place on Afghan soil. Iranian embassy officials in Afghan capital, Kabul were not immediately available for comment on the latest incident.

Malaysian Employers Federation (MEF) executive director Datuk Shamsuddin Bardan said only a small number of sectors had manpower issues for now due to strict government rules and its requirements for foreign workers. \u201cMost employers are dealing with an excess of workers now rather than a shortage following a sharp decline in the global economy due to Covid-19. \u201cThe areas where the authorities are very strict about when it comes to foreign workers are, for example, some of the wet markets and construction industry, where crackdowns have been instituted,\u201d said Shamsuddin. \u201cThe shortage of foreign workers is only limited to certain sectors, namely construction, plantation and some manufacturing sectors.\u201d He said some manufacturers might still require foreign workers, especially those producing high-demand products, such as personal protective equipment. Shamsuddin said it had been hard for the plantation sector to attract locals due to the mistaken belief that jobs in the plantation are low-class. \u201cBut if we look deeper, plantation workers are provided with proper and furnished housing, land to cultivate in, good facilities and depending on one\u2019s effort to work \u2013 only that they live away from towns and cities,\u201d he said. \u201cA worker doing harvesting work can earn more than RM2,000 a month with most of his needs provided for free but Malaysians are not interested.\u201d Shamsuddin said society needed to change their views of less-favourable jobs, such as those deemed 3D \u2013 dirty, dangerous and difficult. He said such jobs could be \u201crebranded\u201d to attract more Malaysian workers. \u201cWe need to modernise these jobs and make them more attractive. \u201cFor example, in Switzerland, only a licensed plumber can legally carry out any work on the plumbing system in a home,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is about upgrading the profession itself so that it is not seen as less attractive jobs.\u201d He said the government should upgrade the skills required for those who want to work in such sectors, which could mean more investment in training, reskilling and upskilling of existing workers. Shamsuddin noted that Malaysia had enough foreign workers for the time being, and only some of them were in the \u201cwrong sector\u201d that was less in demand now. \u201cThe government should facilitate employers to temporarily redeploy these foreign workers, place them at sectors where they are needed without having to retrench and repatriate them,\u201d he said, adding that retrenching and repatriating were rather simplistic and not helping employers to reduce cost in reviving the economy post-Covid-19. Meanwhile, Indonesia has temporarily stopped sending its domestic workers to Malaysia after the MCO was enforced here, said the embassy\u2019s Information, Social and Cultural Affairs counsellor Agung Cahaya Sumirat. \u201cIn tackling the pandemic, the Indonesian government has temporarily halted sending migrants abroad. \u201cWe will see and evaluate the matter later while considering the development of the virus outbreak,\u201d he said in an interview. Malaysia is one of the main destinations for Indonesian migrant workers. According to the embassy\u2019s official data, there are almost 800,000 Indonesian migrants registered in Malaysia. However, it is learnt that the total number including undocumented workers could be three times more than the registered number. \n                \n                "},

South Korea\u2019s Centre for Disease Control and Prevention on Tuesday (May 26) also reported two more deaths, bringing national totals to 11,225 and 269 fatalities. Officials linked three of the new cases to international arrivals. South Korea has been reporting around 20 new cases per day over the past two weeks after health workers found hundreds of infections linked to clubgoers who went out in early May as the country eased on social distancing. The caseload has slowed from early March when it was reporting hundreds of new cases a day, but the new infections in the greater capital area has caused concern as authorities proceed with a phased reopening of schools, which began with high school seniors last week. Around 2.4 million high school juniors, middle school seniors, first- and second-grade elementary school children and kindergartners will be returning to school on Wednesday. Health Minister Park Neung-hoo during a virus meeting urged school officials to double-check their preventive measures. He called for authorities to strengthen monitoring on some 390,000 undocumented foreign nationals who may have poor access to medical services and tests, but related measures weren\u2019t immediately announced. South Korea also Tuesday began requiring people to wear masks on public transit and while using taxis. People in South Korea, like in much of Asia, have generally worn masks in public settings and no major disruptions were reported. Health authorities have left mask enforcement to bus drivers and subway station workers. Taxi drivers are allowed to refuse picking up passengers if they aren\u2019t wearing masks. South Korea since March has banned the exports of masks and channelled most domestically produced masks to pharmacies, where people are currently limited to buying three masks per week. The nationwide rationing was a drastic attempt at calming public anger over shortages, but supply has stabilised. - AP\n                \n                "},

At a press conference held on May 22, Senior Minister Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri Yaakob stated that the 60 confirmed positive cases in Bukit Jalil have been in the centre before the movement control order (MCO) took effect on March 18, and that all 114 of the Immigration officers on duty have tested negative.    While the government has stated that it will be screening detainees, testing alone is not a foolproof measure of preventing the spread of the virus. If the testing is only done once, there is no guarantee that the person would be free from infection, as the infected person may test negative because the test is unable to detect new exposure to infection within five days.    We are aware that three weeks are sufficient to trigger two to three generations of the spread of the virus. Given the pre-existing cramped conditions in the centres and the pressure that will be placed on the infrastructure with more detainees being brought in, we have grave concerns regarding the government\u2019s ability to prevent the transmission of disease.    Contrary to prevailing logic, the government\u2019s punitive approach toward undocumented migrant workers and refugees during this time of crisis poses a public health risk \u2013 for example, some individuals attempted escape from enhanced MCO areas. It also hurts the local economy as many sectors do rely on such workers for their day-to-day operations. It further puts Immigration officers at grave risk of contracting the disease and transmitting it to their family members.    Regrettably, the arrests of undocumented migrant workers by the government at this time has also had another inadvertent impact: It has made immigrant communities distrustful of the health system. This erodes the tremendous efforts made by the Health Ministry to combat this pandemic.    Civil society groups worked hard to be the bridge between immigrant communities and the government to build trust in the health system, which is critical to controlling this outbreak. Upon assurances from the Health Ministry in the early days of the pandemic, they encouraged immigrant and refugee communities to come out for Covid-19 screening voluntarily and without fear. Although non-citizens and the trust they place in a country\u2019s health system may not appear to be a matter of importance from a legal point of view, it is critical from a public health perspective in arresting the spread of disease. Non-health-related ministries need to understand the importance of respecting public health principles while we are in the midst of an outbreak of a disease that has no proven treatment, and that relies critically on prevention of disease transmission to stop spreading.    In this connection, the government must remember that as a member of the global community, the United Nations and the World Health Organisation, it has a higher duty of care towards incarcerated people as well as an obligation to control the spread of the pandemic regionally and globally. The detection of Covid-19 in deported immigrants, as in the case of the immigrants from Myanmar, does not augur well for Malaysia\u2019s international reputation. This is the time for nations to show solidarity and support for battling what is a global pandemic.    Finally, it cannot be over-emphasised that taking care and monitoring the health of large immigrant communities in the country is a way to also protect co-existing local communities.    As such we urgently call upon the government to:    >  Immediately stop the arrests of undocumented immigrants, refugees and asylum seekers as well as stateless persons without documents.    >  Allow the Health Ministry to take the lead in efforts to control the spread of Covid-19, including among non-citizens, and support the ministry in its efforts to combat the pandemic.    >  Invite Suhakam (the Human Rights Commission of Malaysia) to undertake a monitoring visit to detention centres to provide an independent report of the events leading to the detection of Covid-19 cases in them, and to ensure that strong preventive measures are being taken to control disease transmission in the centres.    >  Cooperate with international agencies and civil society organisations to increase detainees\u2019 access to hygiene products and other necessary supplies and to allow the UN High Commission on Refugees to identify and register Persons of Concern.    >  Develop a coherent and rational migration policy framework that links with an effective blueprint of the country\u2019s human resources needs.    >  Preserve the rule of law by taking action against xenophobic hate speech against immigrant communities whose contributions over the years have built this country.

For many of us who observe Ramadan, it is always our hope and desire that we are able to observe this special month in the Islamic calendar as meaningfully as possible and that our good deeds are accepted and our sins forgiven. Ramadan was of course not just a time for fasting but also a time for sacrifice, which we saw plenty of from many of my colleagues and other frontliners who stepped up to be a part of the nation\u2019s Covid-19 response whether directly or indirectly.    It made me especially proud to belong to the public health sector as everybody rallied and worked tirelessly to ensure that we provided the best and safest care to all of our patients while ensuring that we remained safe ourselves. The spectre of getting infected ourselves was real, as we learned of the thousands of healthcare workers who had become infected with Covid-19 and the hundreds who have died from it around the world. But for most of us this is our duty, this was what we had signed up to when we gained the right to call ourselves \u201cdoctor\u201d.    Without a doubt we can be proud of Malaysia\u2019s timely actions and achievements in the country\u2019s response to the Covid-19 threat. Health director-general Datuk Dr Noor Hisham Abdullah and his entire team deserve all the accolades they have received for keeping the level of infection under control, albeit at not an inconsiderable cost.    Despite the intense international effort in search of an effective vaccine, it will still be at least a good 18 months away before any comes into wide use. Given that the pandemic is not going to be going away anytime soon, for us frontliners the challenge will be to maintain these high standards of care and service delivery while adhering to physical distancing and infection control procedures in the long foreseeable future.    Ramadan was also a time for self-reflection, a time and opportunity to reflect on what the pandemic has meant to us as individuals and what it means to our society as a whole. Beyond the inconvenience of the movement control order (MCO) and the fear and anxiety of getting infected, I am sure Covid-19 has meant different things to different people. It has certainly taught me a lot of lessons and made me reflect deeply on what is important and what matters less so. It is a humbling experience to live through this pandemic and see how a 125nm particle has brought the whole world to its knees. From the original epicentre in Wuhan, China, to the wealthy Italian region of Lombardy to bustling New York City, no country has been spared as these little particles found their way across the world and infected more than five million people and killed over 300 000 people in just five short months. The tragedy of this pandemic will one day not only be counted in the number infected and the lives lost but also in how quickly and effectively governments and leaders responded as the epidemic unfolded.    Much has been said about the Covid-19 pandemic bringing to the fore inequalities and divisions in society. It is encouraging that the previously deafening, divisive racial rhetoric in our country has been somewhat muted throughout this epidemic \u2013 though, unfortunately, that has been replaced by the demonisation of foreign workers and undocumented immigrants. Just like the HIV epidemic before it, the Covid-19 pandemic hits especially hard those already vulnerable and marginalised by society. While some of us moan about MCO period restrictions, to many there MCO has meant a loss of income and, to some, even a loss of basic dignity. \u201cWe may be in the same storm, but not all of us are in the same boat\u201d is a saying that vividly captures the inequality that has deepened through this crisis.    We still have many more months of the pandemic to live through and the report card is still out. At this stage we seem to have passed the epidemic control test but as we move forward, the question is will we pass the bigger test? Will we take stock and learn from the devastation of Covid-19 and move towards a more compassionate, mutually respectful, inclusive, equal and just society? Will we continue to close a blind eye to the destruction of the environment in the name of profit and greed? Will we permit science and evidence to inform and guide our policies or will we continue to allow ideology and self-interest to rule?    As a woman of science I try and keep pace with the unprecedented speed and volume of the scientific knowledge on SARS-CoV-2 and use it to inform and improve patient care as well as public health policies. As a woman of faith, I cannot help but feel that Allah swt has unleashed these 125nm particles upon us to make us stop, reflect, learn and find ways in which we can make ourselves and this world a better place, for ourselves and the people we will one day leave it to, our children and their children after them. As a Muslim, there could not have been a better time to do so than the Ramadan just passed.

We acknowledge that we need them for dangerous, dirty and difficult (3D) jobs.    \u201cAs for those who entered the country illegally and do not have valid documents, we have to take action against them. Even then, we do it humanely. When we find that some of them are Covid-19 positive at our depots, we screen all of them -100% - so that they can be saved.    \u201cWe send them to MAEPS (Malaysia Agro Exposition Park Serdang) to be treated. If you check out MAEPS, it is such a nice place and the government has spent millions of ringgit to set it up (as a Covid-19 hospital).    \u201cIf we are worried about an increasing number of positive cases among them, there are two more places they can be placed at. So to call the government inhumane is not fair, \u201d he said.    Ismail Sabri added that the treatment does not change anything about their status.    \u201cThey entered the country illegally and do not have any right to be here. We are in talks with their home countries to take them back. We do not even want to jail them here, \u201d said Ismail Sabri at the National Security Council (MKN)\u2019s daily Covid-19 press conference here.    Ismail Sabri was asked about claims that the Malaysian government had not treated its foreign workers humanely during the Covid-19 pandemic.    On the rounding up of undocumented migrants during the enhanced movement control order (MCO), Ismail Sabri said it had to be done.    \u201cWhen the enhanced MCO is lifted and the barbed wires are removed, the residents of the area are free to move - including those who are undocumented. If we allow them to be free, then it is wrong because they are illegals.    \u201cWe are not taking advantage of them. We send them to our detention depots. If they test negative for Covid-19, we will deport them.    \u201cIt is not nice to accuse Malaysia of mistreatment. In fact, other countries treat them (undocumented migrants) worse. There is no need for politicians or NGOs to act as heroes for undocumented migrants, \u201d he said.    On the capacity of the temporary hospital in MAEPS, Ismail Sabri said it can accommodate 600 patients - with 230 beds in use so far.    \u201cBesides MAEPS, we also have the unused leprosy centre in the Sungai Buloh Hospital and the former maternity wards at the Kuala Lumpur Hospital, giving us a capacity of 1,430 beds, \u201d he said.    As of Tuesday, 382 positive cases were found among detainees at three Immigration Depots in Bukit Jalil, Semenyih and Sepang.      \n                \n                "},

Instead, Aegile Fernandez \u2013 who has 37 years of experience in immigration and human-trafficking issues \u2013 said the government should work with NGOs, civil society and employers to educate migrant workers about the pandemic.    \u201cIf the undocumented foreign workers are treated with kindness, they will seek treatment if they are ill, \u201d she said.    Early this week, most of the Covid-19 clusters were discovered at three immigration detention depots and centres (DTIs) in Sepang, Bukit Jalil and Semenyih.    Health director-general Datuk Dr Noor Hisham Abdullah said that of the 172 cases tested positive in the country on Monday, 112 were from the DTIs.    The next day, 173 foreigners tested positive. Thirteen were security guards from Cheras.    The spike in cases, three-digit figures since May 3, has the public concerned but Dr Noor Hisham assured everyone that the DTIs were in isolated areas and under control by local authorities.    On the same day, Senior Minister Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri Yaakob said the government would send DTI detainees to Covid-19 makeshift hospitals and deport those who were free of Covid-19.    Infectious disease consultant Datuk Dr Christopher Lee concurred with Aegile.    \u201cIf we feel they are a major risk group based on their close living conditions, then we need to engage them rather than make them hide from the authorities, \u201d he said.    Dr Lee also said that if the undocumented workers had acquired the infection inside the camps, then the authorities needed to sort out the hygiene and social distancing issues there although it would pose a challenge due to the huge numbers.    \u201cEthically, we still have to try our best to minimise the risks, \u201d he said.    Universiti Malaya senior research consultant academician Emeritus Prof Datuk Dr Lam Sai Kit also said the Immigration Department should not detain undocumented migrants at this stage to prevent overcrowding.    \u201cDetainees should be educated on how the virus is spread and about personal hygiene, including wearing of face masks, \u201d he said.    However, consultant public health physician Datuk Lokman Hakim Sulaiman agreed with the authorities that detaining undocumented workers would help minimise Covid-19\u2019s spread to the general public and those tested negative should be deported.    \u201cWho will foot their bill if all undocumented workers are required to be tested?\u201d he said. \n                \n                "},

The Malaysian authorities have swept up hundreds of undocumented workers in raids amid its movement control order, while its neighbour Indonesia, home to most of them, is repatriating its citizens. Just as Singapore has struggled to deal with a coronavirus outbreak that spread quickly through its population of foreign workers in dormitories, countries with large numbers of low-wage migrant workers are grappling with similar issues. From Asia to the Middle East, the Covid-19 (coronavirus) pandemic is exposing the unique vulnerabilities of the world's estimated 164 million low-paid migrant workers, who toil at the jobs locals do not want, to save money and get a leg up back home. While some appear to have escaped the same sort of outbreak Singapore is dealing with, activists say good examples of how to manage this segment of their population are few and far between. As Covid-19 takes its toll on economies and public health in many countries, low-wage migrant worker populations have largely been affected disproportionately. Observers say problems include poor living conditions, insufficient legal protection and limited access to healthcare. Last month, Saudi Arabia had shipped home nearly 3,000 of the estimated 200,000 Ethiopians living there before the United Nations called for a halt. In Kuwait last month, at least a dozen migrant workers took their own lives or attempted to, according to migrant-rights.org, an activist website, citing media reports. In Thailand, hundreds of thousands of workers from neighbouring countries like Myanmar, Laos and Cambodia are said to have fled home after a lockdown left them with the prospect of being stuck without money or food. n Malaysia, police rounded up 200 undocumented workers last week alone in Petaling Jaya, outside Kuala Lumpur, even as officials gradually ease movement restrictions. The country is thought to have at least five million migrant workers. Indonesia, one of the world's biggest contributors of labour, has repatriated more than 130,000 of its citizens working abroad as construction workers, cruise ship staff and housekeepers, as well as students. David Welsh, country director of the South-East Asia branch of the Solidarity Centre, a non-profit organisation aligned with the United States-based labour federation AFL-CIO, said the crisis has exposed the poor conditions many migrant workers face. \"Migrant workers have been left aside by governments who have relied on them to do dangerous jobs that have become even more dangerous during this crisis,\" Welsh said. Then, there is Qatar, where observers say criticism of the country's treatment of migrant labour in the wake of its successful bid to host the Fifa World Cup in 2022 has sparked changes that are a lesson to others but also a demonstration of how difficult the process is going to be. Like in Singapore, the outbreak in Qatar has centred on its foreign workers, who outnumber Qataris in the workforce by nearly 20 to one. Total infections have ticked past 40,000 in a country with 2.8 million people. Last October, it abolished exit visas for departing workers and did away with discriminatory laws assigning minimum wages by nationality. The monarchy at the same time abolished the sponsorship rules that tie workers to jobs and make them vulnerable to abuse. The country's new minimum wage laws also override bilateral agreements with countries of origin that can see a Bangladeshi welder, for example, earning two-thirds what a Filipino might. Qatar's ambition to host the World Cup has helped prompt the changes. Shortly after securing the event a decade ago, Qatar publicly promised four weeks' paid leave, overtime and other benefits to workers employed by the contractors awarded work. Contractors erecting more than half a dozen stadiums and other needed infrastructure offer workers attractive terms that meet the scrutiny of activists and unions. Apolinar Tolentino, regional representative for the Building and Wood Workers' International Asia-Pacific, said his union has had regular access to inspect work sites and dormitories where workers are housed four to an air-conditioned room and bunk beds are banned. The visits included group interviews with workers to assess conditions including health and safety, food quality and even Internet speeds. \"Qatar is setting an example in the region of how to treat its migrant labour,\" said Tolentino. But he acknowledges that the improvement has not been even. Earlier this month, the government began easing a two-month lockdown of the sprawling Industrial Area outside of Doha, where hundreds of thousands of workers were holed up in dormitories. The government requires all employers to pay furloughed workers, but there have been reports of workers stranded and begging for food. The problem is fuelled in part by undocumented foreign workers relying on short-term casual work, who do not have regular employers. \"Compliance with standards outside the World Cup projects are more challenging,\" Tolentino said. \"There is almost no direct access by international organisations.\" Last month, Amnesty International and a coalition of non-governmental organisations and trade unions sent letters to Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Bahrain, Kuwait and Oman, raising concerns about migrant workers. Amnesty International's Middle East research director Lynn Maalouf said: \"While some governments made promising commitments to support migrant workers, much more needs to be done to ensure Covid-19 will not result in further human rights violations and greater suffering for migrant workers in these countries.\" - The Straits Times/Asian News Network\n                \n                "},

The Senior Minister said the government has assigned three facilities to house patients from the immigration depot clusters, with a total capacity of about 1,430 beds.    The three places are the Malaysia Agro Exposition Park Serdang (MAEPS), Hospital Sungai Buloh\u2019s leprosy centre and the unused maternity ward at Hospital Kuala Lumpur.    \u201cWe are ready. So far, we only have 230 patients at MAEPS. MAEPS can accommodate 600 patients.    \u201cIn total, all three facilities can put up 1,430 patients. So even if there is an increase in cases, we have enough places, \u201d he said at the National Security Council\u2019s daily Covid-19 press briefing here.    Ismail Sabri also defended the government\u2019s treatment of undocumented migrants throughout the Covid-19 pandemic.    He said those without documents were of illegal status in the country no matter what, adding that it was the Immigration Department\u2019s duty to manage them.    \u201cNothing changes their status. They entered the country illegally and do not have any right to be here. We are in talks with their home countries to take them back. We do not even want to jail them here, \u201d he said.    Ismail Sabri said foreign workers \u2013 whether legal or illegal \u2013 have been treated humanely by the Malaysian government.    \u201cForeigners with valid work permits are protected.

On a related matter, Ismail Sabri, who is also Defence Minister, said 824 motorists that attempted interstate travel without permission on Tuesday were told to turn back - an increase from the 738 attempts recorded the day before.    He said the police has also detained 136 individuals, of which 75 were remanded while 61 were on bail for defying the conditional movement control order (MCO).    \u201cCompounds were also issued to 534 individuals for various offences under the conditional MCO, \u201d he said.    States that recorded the highest number of attempts to cross borders are Selangor (284), Kedah (122) and Melaka (113).    Ismail Sabri also said that audit firms that instructed their staff to work in different states were breaching the conditional MCO.    \u201cAs I have mentioned previously, interstate travels are only for emergencies such as a death or for close family members to visit those who are very ill.    \u201cAuditors wanting to check accounts of (their clients) is obviously not part of it.

H.H. Tan, who owns a tile and flooring company as well as a construction company, said he ensured his 14 Indonesian workers have ample personal space.    \u201cI have a double-storey house for them and each bedroom has one to two occupants only.    \u201cI have also forbidden any socialising with outsiders and have taken it upon myself to do all their shopping for them, \u201d he said.    Tan said since they could resume work when the conditional movement control order (MCO) came into effect, he ensured social distancing was practised at the workplace.\u201cWe are working at a slower pace and I do not bring all my workers to the site at once, \u2019\u2019 said Tan, adding that he has also sent all his workers for Covid-19 testing.    The workers\u2019 temperatures were taken and recorded every morning before they go to the worksite.    Meanwhile, state investment, industry and trade, small and medium industries committee chairman Datuk Teng Chang Khim said the Selangor government was helping the Health Ministry in its efforts to detect and curb Covid-19 infection among construction workers.    \u201cThe state cannot take the lead on this matter and thus we are doing everything possible to complement the initiatives taken by the ministry, \u2019\u2019 said Teng.    This included having a budget to go towards carrying out screening of construction workers and providing whatever else was required by the Health Ministry.    \u201cFor instance, if the ministry has insufficient personal protective gears, we will provide them with these, \u2019\u2019 said Teng, adding that the Health Ministry was doing the right thing to stem Covid-19 cases in the construction industry.    Teng said sending home undocumented workers who were Covid-19 negative as well as random testing was the only viable option at the moment.    Meanwhile, state health, welfare, women empowerment and family committee chairman Dr Siti Mariah Mahmud said RM2.06mil has been allocated by the Selangor government for screening of high risk groups.    \u201cWe\u2019ll be having a meeting with Mentri Besar Datuk Seri Amirudin Shari, the state health department as well as Selangor Task Force for Covid-19 on June 1 to determine all the high risk groups for screening, \u2019\u2019 said Dr Siti Mariah.    She added that PPEs were also being produced by the state\u2019s Women Development Centre in collaboration with Hospital Banting.    In Sabah, things are rough. Many construction sites are not running due to employers\u2019 inability to get their workers tested for Covid-19.    Sabah Builders Association (SBA) president Lou Chi Nam said that feedback from SBA\u2019s 100-odd members was that most of them would not begin work until June \u2013 and if the conditional MCO were to be over.\u201cOne of the requirements to start operating is that these workers must have gotten tested for the virus and results obtained, \u201d he said. \u201cBut since many are not able to, mainly due to the cost, they cannot operate, \u201d he said.    Lou said those who could afford to pay for their workers\u2019 swab tests also had to wait for a long period as there was a limit to the number of tests health officials could conduct in a day. \n                \n                "},

Its executive director Datuk Shamsuddin Bardan said the government\u2019s decision to enforce the amendment to the Workers\u2019 Minimum Standards of Housing and Amenities Act on June 1 was insensitive and did not take into account the problems faced by employers.    \u201cInstead, the government should assist employers by guiding them and workers on how Covid-19 can be prevented at their quarters.\u201d    The amendment will now include workers from all industries, including construction, with a three-month grace period granted to employers to implement it.    Shamsuddin said the minimum space requirement per worker living in a permanent dwelling is 4.8sq m while temporary dwelling is 3sq m.    \u201cThe space required for individual employees is demanding and costly and yet the maximum allowable charge on accommodation currently is only RM50 per worker, way below the centralised housing cost of RM100 to RM150 at market rate.    \u201cSome employers may have to send home some foreign workers because they don\u2019t have enough financial resources to comply with it,\u201d he said, adding that the government should target undocumented workers in which most Covid-19 cases were detected.    He also said that the grace period was too short as they were trying to cope with the requirements under the conditional movement control order to revive businesses.    Shamsuddin said providing \u201ckongsi\u201d type accommodation at construction sites would no longer be feasible under the new law.    \u201cAccommodation will be further away from construction sites and there is a need to provide transportation, which adds cost and travel time,\u201d he said.    However, Malaysian Medical Association president Dr N.

Federation of Malaysian Manufacturers (FMM) president Tan Sri Soh Thian Lai said the amendments to the Minimum Standards of Housing and Amenities (Amendment) Act was a good decision in the long term as it would ensure conducive housing condition for all workers, and enhance the health and productivity of the workforce in the country.    However, Soh said the amendments, which would come into force on June 1 in Peninsular Malaysia and the Federal Territory of Labuan, could pose some challenges to fulfilling them.    The Human Resources Ministry said the government would give a three-month grace period until Aug 31 to give room for employers to make the necessary arrangements.    The enforcement under the Act will begin on Sept 1. The amendments to the Act was passed in Parliament last July and was gazetted on Sept 18.    \u201cBut with the huge number of foreign workers in Malaysia, around two million documented and about four million undocumented, it could pose a big challenge to fulfil conditions under the amendments of the Act within 15 months, including the three-month grace period as all affected employers who employ foreign workers must comply with it, \u201d said Soh.    \u201cNow that the highest risk clusters of Covid-19 infections are foreign workers, this Act is timely \u2013 but it\u2019s too short a time to get the employers prepared.    \u201cWe urge the authorities to give more time, at least six months, for companies to reset and rearrange according to the standard operating procedure (SOP), \u201d Soh said.    Soh said the government should now focus on the construction sites and quarters of foreign workers in the yellow and red zones as they were the high-risk clusters.    \u201cThe most important thing is for all companies with foreign workers to follow the SOP set by the Health Ministry and authorities to minimise the risks, \u201d he said.    Master Builders Association of Malaysia (MBAM) president Foo Chek Lee said it was in full support of the implementation of the amendment, which it helped to draft years ago.    \u201cA worker needs a good place to stay and rest.    \u201cIf they don\u2019t have proper rest, they can\u2019t work and if their living condition is not good, they will get sick and it affects productivity, \u201d he said.    Foo said big construction companies would not have problems to provide housing according to the guidelines.    He pointed out that some workers, however, were labourers who did not have permanent employment and chose to live in cramped conditions to save money.    \u201cThe main contractor and project owners are liable to provide proper accommodation to foreign workers.    \u201cHowever, some sub-contractors may still resort to providing housing in the form of kongsi or hostel but now they would have to follow the guidelines under the amendments, \u201d he said.    Foo, however, said the grace period was tight as it did not give much time for companies to prepare.    \u201cBut this is an extraordinary time with Covid-19, so companies will have to push and make it happen to safeguard public health, \u201d Foo added.    Real Estate and Housing Developers Association (Rehda) national council member Tony Khoo Boon Chuan said there was confusion on the ground as the detailed SOP was not available.    When asked on the ramification of the amendments, Khoo said the extra cost from providing housing, according to guidelines, would be transferred to home buyers eventually.    \u201cThis will result in more expensive houses and properties, \u201d he said.    Bina Puri Holdings group executive director Matthew Tee said although the amendments came at a cost, the industry would have to manage it.    \u201cWe try to follow the guidelines but all these implementations come at a cost, at a time when the construction sector is undergoing a recession, \u201d said Tee. \n                \n                "},

Malaysia\u2019s economy relies on palm oil, its most important agricultural commodity, but palm oil needs migrant workers from Indonesia, Bangladesh and India to do jobs locals won\u2019t. As countries in South-East Asia struggle to get the Covid-19 outbreak under control, governments have tightened restrictions on travel for workers both coming and going. \"In the past, when people left, people also came,\u201d said Nageeb Wahab, chief executive at the Malaysian Palm Oil Association, a growers\u2019 group that represents 40% of palm plantations by area. \"Now, the coming is nil, and the leaving may be more after Malaysia\u2019s movement control order.\u201d Though environmental activists have pushed to rein in the palm industry for years, the labor shortage there signals the disruption unfolding at companies and farms around the world that depend on migrant workers. More than 70% of the country\u2019s plantation workers come from outside Malaysia\u2019s borders, according to an estimate by Rabobank; the country produces about 26% of the world\u2019s most common cooking oil. Production was already expected to drop by as much as 10% due to last year\u2019s dry weather and less aggressive fertilization. Now the labor shortage suggests the shortfall could more than double, Nageeb said, and growers are beginning to fidget. In April, top producer United Plantations Bhd. warned investors of a potential threat to production in the second half of 2020 \"as the present lockdown policy and restrictions on travel in many South East Asian countries will prevent guest workers from Indonesia, Bangladesh or India from seeking job opportunities in the Malaysian plantation industry.\u201d \u201dWe are indeed caught between a rock and a hard place as the first priority is of course to strictly adhere to the governments directives to keep Malaysia safe and Covid-19-free,\u201d Chief Executive Director Carl Bek-Nielsen said by email. That would mean the recruitment process to hire guest workers probably can\u2019t resume for the rest of the year, which would \"aggravate and exacerbate an already perilous situation for many plantation companies.\u201d Labor Squeeze Labor shortages have plagued growers for years, though never this acutely. Malaysia\u2019s plantations are now competing with higher wages offered by the growing industry in Indonesia, the world\u2019s biggest producer, and while benefits and employment practices vary, the industry has a reputation for exploitation and abuse. Automation has offered little relief. Palm fruit is fragile, growing in bunches that can weigh as much as 100 pounds, 60 feet off the ground. Most of it is still harvested by hand. Compared with soy or rapeseed, harvesting palm fruit requires 25 times more workers. The sudden and rapid outbreak of the coronavirus has turned long-term challenges into short-term ones, said Aurelia Britsch, head of commodities at Fitch Solutions. \"The sector is currently recording labor shortages, as ongoing lockdown measures mean palm oil estates are generally unable to recruit new foreign workers at a time when some employees have been repatriated to their origin countries due to the pandemic.\u201d In better times, the farmers might have raised wages to attract more workers. Not now, with global economies in free-fall and commodities prices growing more volatile. Even with a shortage of labor and, potentially, supply, the tropical oil on course for its biggest annual drop since 2012. \u201dThe reality is stark,\u201d United\u2019s Bek-Nielsen said. \"Growers are fearing that field losses will creep up from August-September towards the end of the year in tune with more and more guest workers returning home on leave. It is sadly a one-way traffic for the rest of 2020.\u201d Stopping production is an option for rubber and other crops, a way to use less labor and eat into stockpiles, forcing prices to rise. Palm isn\u2019t that flexible. \"It\u2019s not as simple as stopping production to let prices go up,\u201d said Nageeb. \"The moment you stop your production for two weeks, to bring it back to normal will take two months.\u201d Without enough workers to harvest the crop in a timely way, palm fruit will rot. The fruit that is harvested also has to be sent quickly to crushing mills or it\u2019ll start to oxidize, increasing acidity levels and reducing oil quality. Manual labor\u2019s also required to keep trees pruned and healthy for future seasons. Migrant Exodus For migrant workers, the virus outbreak and the lockdowns that followed have been been grueling. Those who left may not be able to return, losing a steady, if modest, source of income. Those that stayed faced other problems, said Glorene Das, executive director of Tenaganita, a Malaysian NGO that promotes rights of migrant workers and refugees. The government requires employers to provide workers with adequate social distance and protective gear, as well as routinely disinfected work environments. That applies to plantation operators too, but \"the remoteness of these locations and the lack of labor inspectors contribute to difficulty in enforcement,\u201d according to the International Labour Organization. During the lockdown, some plantation workers struggled to get enough food and other basic supplies. Documented and undocumented Indonesian workers are the biggest contingent among Malaysia\u2019s immigrant palm laborers. When the country imposed its nationwide lockdown, many workers on short-stay visas returned to Indonesia, said Zana Amir, program officer at Migrant Care, a Jakarta-headquartered group. \"They feared having no income in Malaysia, as the government conducted raids on illegal workers,\u201d Zana said. The labor shortages are likely to worsen, analysts predict, as governments try to combat the coronavirus-induced recession and rising unemployment. \"In Malaysia, this is likely to lead to stricter immigration regulations,\u201d said Fitch\u2019s Britsch. \"Given plantations\u2019 large reliance on foreign labor, these regulations will aggravate further the rising labor challenges palm oil companies have been facing in recent years.\u201d When and if Malaysia eases restrictions on travel or work visas, workers may not return en masse, said Oscar Tjakra, Singapore-based analyst at Rabobank. \"It will take some time for migrant workers who had left the country to travel back to Malaysia,\u201d he said. \"These migrant workers will monitor the coronavirus outbreak situation and economic situation in Malaysia before deciding to come back.\u201d - Bloomberg\n                \n                "},

Malaysian Employers Federation (MEF) executive director Datuk Shamsuddin Bardan said only a small number of sectors had manpower issues for now due to strict government rules and its requirements for foreign workers. \u201cMost employers are dealing with an excess of workers now rather than a shortage following a sharp decline in the global economy due to Covid-19. \u201cThe areas where the authorities are very strict about when it comes to foreign workers are, for example, some of the wet markets and construction industry, where crackdowns have been instituted,\u201d said Shamsuddin. \u201cThe shortage of foreign workers is only limited to certain sectors, namely construction, plantation and some manufacturing sectors.\u201d He said some manufacturers might still require foreign workers, especially those producing high-demand products, such as personal protective equipment. Shamsuddin said it had been hard for the plantation sector to attract locals due to the mistaken belief that jobs in the plantation are low-class. \u201cBut if we look deeper, plantation workers are provided with proper and furnished housing, land to cultivate in, good facilities and depending on one\u2019s effort to work \u2013 only that they live away from towns and cities,\u201d he said. \u201cA worker doing harvesting work can earn more than RM2,000 a month with most of his needs provided for free but Malaysians are not interested.\u201d Shamsuddin said society needed to change their views of less-favourable jobs, such as those deemed 3D \u2013 dirty, dangerous and difficult. He said such jobs could be \u201crebranded\u201d to attract more Malaysian workers. \u201cWe need to modernise these jobs and make them more attractive. \u201cFor example, in Switzerland, only a licensed plumber can legally carry out any work on the plumbing system in a home,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is about upgrading the profession itself so that it is not seen as less attractive jobs.\u201d He said the government should upgrade the skills required for those who want to work in such sectors, which could mean more investment in training, reskilling and upskilling of existing workers. Shamsuddin noted that Malaysia had enough foreign workers for the time being, and only some of them were in the \u201cwrong sector\u201d that was less in demand now. \u201cThe government should facilitate employers to temporarily redeploy these foreign workers, place them at sectors where they are needed without having to retrench and repatriate them,\u201d he said, adding that retrenching and repatriating were rather simplistic and not helping employers to reduce cost in reviving the economy post-Covid-19. Meanwhile, Indonesia has temporarily stopped sending its domestic workers to Malaysia after the MCO was enforced here, said the embassy\u2019s Information, Social and Cultural Affairs counsellor Agung Cahaya Sumirat. \u201cIn tackling the pandemic, the Indonesian government has temporarily halted sending migrants abroad. \u201cWe will see and evaluate the matter later while considering the development of the virus outbreak,\u201d he said in an interview. Malaysia is one of the main destinations for Indonesian migrant workers. According to the embassy\u2019s official data, there are almost 800,000 Indonesian migrants registered in Malaysia. However, it is learnt that the total number including undocumented workers could be three times more than the registered number. \n                \n                "},

For mother-of-two Aracely Mediavilla, the weekly deliveries of food and essential supplies from Barcelona-based volunteers have been a lifeline since she returned to Spain from Ecuador in the hope of getting her elder son medical treatment. \"It's not just a box of food - it's a box of love, of hope,\" said Mediavilla, fighting back tears. \"I am grateful for it because my children have been able to eat and feel loved.\" Mediavilla, 28, lived in Barcelona for years before Spain's 2008 economic crisis, and decided to return when her son Julian was diagnosed with retinopathy which blinded him in one eye. But the coronavirus lockdown, now in its 13th week, made it impossible for Mediavilla to get a job, and with a second newborn boy in tow, she and her mother Alicia rely on the help of a group of parishioners called Maria Auxiliadora, or Mary of Succour. The volunteers, who are associated to Santa Anna church in central Barcelona, gathered funds to provide Mediavilla's son Julian with special glasses. They also helped her land a job as an admnistrative assistant in a laboratory, which she began last week. On one sunny morning outside Santa Anna, the breakfast line stretched far down the street, with volunteers distributing reusable face masks to people as they queued for sacks of basic supplies and a cup of milky coffee. \"We do a breakfast, lunch and dinner service every day,\" said Peio Sanchez, priest at Santa Anna. \"This queue has been increasing, firstly because of the undocumented migrants.\" Undocumented immigrants are often precariously - and informally - employed, making them especially vulnerable to economic shocks and difficult domestic situations, Sanchez said. \"From the second month (we attended) people who had not received the corresponding aid and who no longer had the resources to pay for food and rent,\" Sanchez added. The priest expects Barcelona's homeless population - currently 1,500 - to triple in the next two years. Similar scenes have played out in Aluche, a poor neighbourhood in the capital Madrid. Spain's strict lockdown cost the economy 900,000 jobs in the second half of March alone. Last week, Spain approved an income support programme for about 2.5 million of its poorest citizens, set at about half the minimum wage of 1,108 euros $1,244.84) per month.

{"title": "\n            Appropriate living conditions are essential for the migrant workers\n        ", "region": "Letters\n                        ", "date": 0, "text": "\n                 \n                                                \n                 Malaysians recently have been worried by news of a spike in Covid-19 infections among foreign workers. The situation is similar to what happened in Singapore with the number of local cases going down and a spike in new cases appearing among foreign workers. Clusters of Covid-19 infections have been detected at three construction sites and three immigration depots. More than 4,000 undocumented immigrants have been detained at these depots for not possessing valid travel and work documents. As the number of cases have increased, some have started to blame foreign workers for the spread of the disease \u2013 but is it justifiable to do so?    Let us first look at the factors that work against efforts to mitigate the spread of the virus. According to the Health director-general Datuk Dr Noor Hisham Abdullah, the main factors are the workers\u2019 crowded living environment and poor hygiene practices. But migrant workers should not be the only ones blamed for such conditions. Aside from probably being uneducated about hygiene, it is very likely that the workers have no choice about living in crowded conditions because that is all they can afford on their low wages or because those are the accommodations that they have been provided by their employers.    Employers who are responsible for this should also bear some of the responsibility. The implementation of standard operating procedures (SOPs) to mitigate the spread of Covid-19 should not only be limited to worksites.    Dr Noor Hisham has called on employers to ensure that physical distancing measures at workers\u2019 accommodations are taken seriously by having beds at least 1m to 2m apart, enough space so they can avoid preparing and consuming food in large groups, and ensuring that toilets and surrounding areas are clean and sanitised.    As stated in the Workers\u2019 Minimum Standards of Housing and Amenities Act (Amended 2019) \u2013 scheduled to have taken effect on June 1, 2020, in Peninsular Malaysia and Labuan \u2013 one of the duties and responsibilities of an employer associated with the current situation is laid out under Section 24J: (f) To take preventive measures to contain the spread of infectious diseases as ordered by the Medical Officer of Health in accordance with relevant written laws, the employer shall, at his own expense, make arrangements as ordered by the Medical Officer of Health so that all or any of the employees be given immunisation against any infectious disease. Another sub-section of Section 24J that is closely related is (b) to take necessary preventive measures to ensure employees\u2019 safety and well-being. So it is actually written into law that it is the employers\u2019 obligation to take action to curb the spread of Covid-19 among their foreign workers.    The right action has been pursued by making it compulsory for foreign workers in all sectors to undergo Covid-19 screening after the rise in the number of cases at construction sites. But the screening has to go along with preventive measures that ensure the workers have appropriate accommodations where they can maintain physical distancing.    On May 28, 2020, Human Resources Minister Datuk Seri M. Saravanan announced that the government is giving employers a grace period of three months, until Aug 31, to comply with the amendments to the Workers\u2019 Minimum Standards of Housing and Amenities Act. However, the deadly nature of the pandemic that could worsen current conditions quickly should be the key reason for employers to not delay complying with the Act. The amendments were passed in Parliament in July 2019, then gazetted in September 2019, so the duration since then should have provided sufficient time for employers. Delaying compliance would be irresponsible, as the spread of Covid-19 places Malaysian citizens at risk along with foreign workers.    Furthermore, as most of the foreign workers are hired for \u201c3D jobs\u201d (dangerous, dirty and difficult), they are accustomed to and accepting of unhygienic surroundings. So awareness about the severity of the pandemic and the need for hygiene to stop the spread of the virus needs to be instilled by educating them on SOPs at worksites and their accommodations.    Although we hope this spike of Covid-19 cases in Malaysia will not be as bad as Singapore\u2019s, as noted by Universiti Malaya public health specialist Dr Rafdzah Ahmad Zaki, prompt measures must be taken because foreign workers make up 15% to 30% of Malaysia\u2019s labour force. Singapore should be a wake-up call for Malaysia, and we can learn lessons from the experience there. The enforcement of the amended Act should not be delayed as it is not only important to prevent the virus spreading widely but also for the well-being of the workers.

Kuala Lumpur mayor Datuk Nor Hisham Ahmad Dahlan said the blitz was carried out following enforcement officers\u2019 investigation as well as tip-off from business owners and the public.    He said dozens of foreigners were undocumented and were operating using expired or illegal work permits or using licence that was sublet to them by Malaysians.    The businesses range from restaurants, sundry shops, fruit and vegetable stalls to tailoring business, car wash and telephone accessories shops.

The government will also launch next year the 12th Malaysia Plan (2021-2025), which will outline the medium and longer term policies for achieving our nation's development goals and provide the public sector expenditure programme to implement such policies.    In carrying out its development plans for economic and social progress, the government must place more focus on the human aspects of development to empower the people to face the challenges that lie ahead, such as a second round of the pandemic and the uncertainties arising from the geo-political tensions around the world.    We will have to increasingly rely on our own domestic strength to remain resilient against the adverse external developments. Hence, our development plans must place greater attention on improving the quality of the education and training system to create the internal capacity for growth and prosperity. They should equip school leavers and graduates with a stronger foundation to learn new skills.    Employers prefer to recruit job applicants who are trainable to raise their productivity and technical skills. New entrants to the labour market who are good in Maths, Science and English and who impress employers with their confident personality will find it easier to get the better paid jobs.    Those whose parents can afford to send their children for private tuition in Maths, Science, languages, music and art tend to have the advantage in having these superior qualities in them. There is a growing number of children who go to expensive private schools locally and abroad. These are the children of privileged families, political and corporate elites and the middle class.    This division of success in finding good jobs between income classes is not healthy for national unity. The national education system should therefore introduce reforms to provide the quality required in the employment market. Education should be free from racial, religious and communal politics to allow reforms to be successfully implemented so that all youths will have a level playing field in life.    In general, wage levels in Malaysia are low relative to its per capita GDP and standard of development. The main reason is the weak labour policies on employment and lack of controls on importing foreign workers. Irresponsible employers are taking advantage of undocumented workers, who out-number their legal counterparts, to suppress wage levels and ignore workers rights across all segments of the labour market. The culture of low wages spreads to all levels of employment, including executives. The result is that the share of wages in national income in Malaysia is low by international standards, thus indicating an imbalance in the distribution of the country\u2019s wealth between owners of capital and the working class.    Depressed wage levels explain much of the hardships among households living in the major urban centres. In addition, urban households struggle with the higher cost of living in cities compared to the rest of the country.    As our planners work on policies for the recovery of the economy and its long-term growth, they would prioritise projects that have a high impact on generating employment and income opportunities. This is to be expected as GDP growth is essential to lift up income levels.    At the same time, our planning agencies should also strengthen the education and labour policies to make them more dynamic in providing our working population with better wages and a higher share of the national income.    With higher levels of skills, the talent pool will be enhanced and facilitate Malaysia\u2019s efforts to attract more local and foreign investment into high technology and state-of-the-art industries, as the East Asian Tigers have done to restructure their economy and    become so advanced in their standards of living. They placed high priority on investing in their human resources to transform into high income countries within a short period of one generation.

He added that 1,972 Malaysians had returned to the country, bringing the total number of those returning home from abroad to 46,859 since April 3.    Of this, he said that 36,128 Malaysians who had returned from abroad were allowed to go home after undergoing mandatory 14-days quarantine.    On a separate matter, Ismail Sabri warned state football associations not to approve the resumption of matches if the current conditional movement control order (MCO) ends on June 9.    He said discussions are being held with the Football Association of Malaysia (FAM) and the Health Ministry to determine the measures if and when the local football league is to restart again.    However, he said the respective state football associations could draft up their own standard operating procedures (SOPs) in the meantime while waiting for a final decision from the government.    He was asked if football matches could resume with no spectators such as what is being proposed for the English Premier League.    The government has eased restrictions for non-contact sports under the conditional MCO such as jogging, badminton and golf.      \n                \n                "},

Afghanistan's foreign ministry said in a statement on Friday three Afghans were killed and four injured in Iran's central Yazd province after their vehicle was shot at by Iranian police, triggering the fire.  Video footage posted on social media showed a boy escaping from the blazing car with burns on parts of his body and begging for water. The ministry said the video was genuine and Afghans in Iran were trying to identify the victims. The boy's plea of \"give me some water, I am burning\" was widely circulated on social media and taken up by rights group demanding justice. \"Iran has no right to kill Afghan refugees, they can seal their borders, expel all Afghans but not kill them,\" said Ali Noori, a lawyer and rights activist said on Facebook. Afghans have for decades sought refuge in Iran from war and poverty in their homeland. Iran says about 2.5 million Afghan migrants, both legal and undocumented, live there. Facing its own economic problems worsened by international sanctions, Iran has at times tried to send Afghans home. Last month, Afghan officials said Iranian border guards killed 45 Afghan migrant workers by forcing them at gunpoint into a mountain torrent on the border. At the time, Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi issued a statement saying only that the incident in question had taken place on Afghan soil. Iranian embassy officials in Afghan capital, Kabul were not immediately available for comment on the latest incident.

South Korea\u2019s Centre for Disease Control and Prevention on Tuesday (May 26) also reported two more deaths, bringing national totals to 11,225 and 269 fatalities. Officials linked three of the new cases to international arrivals. South Korea has been reporting around 20 new cases per day over the past two weeks after health workers found hundreds of infections linked to clubgoers who went out in early May as the country eased on social distancing. The caseload has slowed from early March when it was reporting hundreds of new cases a day, but the new infections in the greater capital area has caused concern as authorities proceed with a phased reopening of schools, which began with high school seniors last week. Around 2.4 million high school juniors, middle school seniors, first- and second-grade elementary school children and kindergartners will be returning to school on Wednesday. Health Minister Park Neung-hoo during a virus meeting urged school officials to double-check their preventive measures. He called for authorities to strengthen monitoring on some 390,000 undocumented foreign nationals who may have poor access to medical services and tests, but related measures weren\u2019t immediately announced. South Korea also Tuesday began requiring people to wear masks on public transit and while using taxis. People in South Korea, like in much of Asia, have generally worn masks in public settings and no major disruptions were reported. Health authorities have left mask enforcement to bus drivers and subway station workers. Taxi drivers are allowed to refuse picking up passengers if they aren\u2019t wearing masks. South Korea since March has banned the exports of masks and channelled most domestically produced masks to pharmacies, where people are currently limited to buying three masks per week. The nationwide rationing was a drastic attempt at calming public anger over shortages, but supply has stabilised. - AP\n                \n                "},

At a press conference held on May 22, Senior Minister Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri Yaakob stated that the 60 confirmed positive cases in Bukit Jalil have been in the centre before the movement control order (MCO) took effect on March 18, and that all 114 of the Immigration officers on duty have tested negative.    While the government has stated that it will be screening detainees, testing alone is not a foolproof measure of preventing the spread of the virus. If the testing is only done once, there is no guarantee that the person would be free from infection, as the infected person may test negative because the test is unable to detect new exposure to infection within five days.    We are aware that three weeks are sufficient to trigger two to three generations of the spread of the virus. Given the pre-existing cramped conditions in the centres and the pressure that will be placed on the infrastructure with more detainees being brought in, we have grave concerns regarding the government\u2019s ability to prevent the transmission of disease.    Contrary to prevailing logic, the government\u2019s punitive approach toward undocumented migrant workers and refugees during this time of crisis poses a public health risk \u2013 for example, some individuals attempted escape from enhanced MCO areas. It also hurts the local economy as many sectors do rely on such workers for their day-to-day operations. It further puts Immigration officers at grave risk of contracting the disease and transmitting it to their family members.    Regrettably, the arrests of undocumented migrant workers by the government at this time has also had another inadvertent impact: It has made immigrant communities distrustful of the health system. This erodes the tremendous efforts made by the Health Ministry to combat this pandemic.    Civil society groups worked hard to be the bridge between immigrant communities and the government to build trust in the health system, which is critical to controlling this outbreak. Upon assurances from the Health Ministry in the early days of the pandemic, they encouraged immigrant and refugee communities to come out for Covid-19 screening voluntarily and without fear. Although non-citizens and the trust they place in a country\u2019s health system may not appear to be a matter of importance from a legal point of view, it is critical from a public health perspective in arresting the spread of disease. Non-health-related ministries need to understand the importance of respecting public health principles while we are in the midst of an outbreak of a disease that has no proven treatment, and that relies critically on prevention of disease transmission to stop spreading.    In this connection, the government must remember that as a member of the global community, the United Nations and the World Health Organisation, it has a higher duty of care towards incarcerated people as well as an obligation to control the spread of the pandemic regionally and globally. The detection of Covid-19 in deported immigrants, as in the case of the immigrants from Myanmar, does not augur well for Malaysia\u2019s international reputation. This is the time for nations to show solidarity and support for battling what is a global pandemic.    Finally, it cannot be over-emphasised that taking care and monitoring the health of large immigrant communities in the country is a way to also protect co-existing local communities.    As such we urgently call upon the government to:    >  Immediately stop the arrests of undocumented immigrants, refugees and asylum seekers as well as stateless persons without documents.    >  Allow the Health Ministry to take the lead in efforts to control the spread of Covid-19, including among non-citizens, and support the ministry in its efforts to combat the pandemic.    >  Invite Suhakam (the Human Rights Commission of Malaysia) to undertake a monitoring visit to detention centres to provide an independent report of the events leading to the detection of Covid-19 cases in them, and to ensure that strong preventive measures are being taken to control disease transmission in the centres.    >  Cooperate with international agencies and civil society organisations to increase detainees\u2019 access to hygiene products and other necessary supplies and to allow the UN High Commission on Refugees to identify and register Persons of Concern.    >  Develop a coherent and rational migration policy framework that links with an effective blueprint of the country\u2019s human resources needs.    >  Preserve the rule of law by taking action against xenophobic hate speech against immigrant communities whose contributions over the years have built this country.

For many of us who observe Ramadan, it is always our hope and desire that we are able to observe this special month in the Islamic calendar as meaningfully as possible and that our good deeds are accepted and our sins forgiven. Ramadan was of course not just a time for fasting but also a time for sacrifice, which we saw plenty of from many of my colleagues and other frontliners who stepped up to be a part of the nation\u2019s Covid-19 response whether directly or indirectly.    It made me especially proud to belong to the public health sector as everybody rallied and worked tirelessly to ensure that we provided the best and safest care to all of our patients while ensuring that we remained safe ourselves. The spectre of getting infected ourselves was real, as we learned of the thousands of healthcare workers who had become infected with Covid-19 and the hundreds who have died from it around the world. But for most of us this is our duty, this was what we had signed up to when we gained the right to call ourselves \u201cdoctor\u201d.    Without a doubt we can be proud of Malaysia\u2019s timely actions and achievements in the country\u2019s response to the Covid-19 threat. Health director-general Datuk Dr Noor Hisham Abdullah and his entire team deserve all the accolades they have received for keeping the level of infection under control, albeit at not an inconsiderable cost.    Despite the intense international effort in search of an effective vaccine, it will still be at least a good 18 months away before any comes into wide use. Given that the pandemic is not going to be going away anytime soon, for us frontliners the challenge will be to maintain these high standards of care and service delivery while adhering to physical distancing and infection control procedures in the long foreseeable future.    Ramadan was also a time for self-reflection, a time and opportunity to reflect on what the pandemic has meant to us as individuals and what it means to our society as a whole. Beyond the inconvenience of the movement control order (MCO) and the fear and anxiety of getting infected, I am sure Covid-19 has meant different things to different people. It has certainly taught me a lot of lessons and made me reflect deeply on what is important and what matters less so. It is a humbling experience to live through this pandemic and see how a 125nm particle has brought the whole world to its knees. From the original epicentre in Wuhan, China, to the wealthy Italian region of Lombardy to bustling New York City, no country has been spared as these little particles found their way across the world and infected more than five million people and killed over 300 000 people in just five short months. The tragedy of this pandemic will one day not only be counted in the number infected and the lives lost but also in how quickly and effectively governments and leaders responded as the epidemic unfolded.    Much has been said about the Covid-19 pandemic bringing to the fore inequalities and divisions in society. It is encouraging that the previously deafening, divisive racial rhetoric in our country has been somewhat muted throughout this epidemic \u2013 though, unfortunately, that has been replaced by the demonisation of foreign workers and undocumented immigrants. Just like the HIV epidemic before it, the Covid-19 pandemic hits especially hard those already vulnerable and marginalised by society. While some of us moan about MCO period restrictions, to many there MCO has meant a loss of income and, to some, even a loss of basic dignity. \u201cWe may be in the same storm, but not all of us are in the same boat\u201d is a saying that vividly captures the inequality that has deepened through this crisis.    We still have many more months of the pandemic to live through and the report card is still out. At this stage we seem to have passed the epidemic control test but as we move forward, the question is will we pass the bigger test? Will we take stock and learn from the devastation of Covid-19 and move towards a more compassionate, mutually respectful, inclusive, equal and just society? Will we continue to close a blind eye to the destruction of the environment in the name of profit and greed? Will we permit science and evidence to inform and guide our policies or will we continue to allow ideology and self-interest to rule?

The Deputy Tourism, Arts and Culture Minister said this forum was aimed at engaging stakeholders and the public to gather feedback and find solutions to resolve the problem of illegal immigrants, particularly in Sabah.    \u201cThe Covid-19 pandemic has in a way created an unprecedented opportunity in highlighting the presence of the millions of illegal and unlawful foreigners in Malaysia,\u201d Jeffrey said in a statement here on Tuesday (May 26).    He cited as examples various news reports over the arrests of illegal immigrants in Sabah as well as reports of attempted entry by Rohingya in Langkawi and north-western Peninsular Malaysia.    Jeffrey said illegal immigrants and undocumented foreigners in Malaysia had been receiving much media coverage and causing social media anger from netizens recently.    \u201cThese foreigners and illegals pose a huge threat, not just because of the Covid-19 infections and social problems. A long-term sustainable solution needs to be put in place,\u201d Jeffrey said.    He said the time has come for concerted efforts by all stakeholders and connected parties to sit down and work out a holistic long-term plan to deal with illegal immigrants and undocumented persons in Malaysia.    He said he has nothing against legal foreigners entering Sabah via proper means, but not through backdoor routes.    \u201cBy all means, they are welcome in Malaysia - but it must be through the proper immigration channels with proper documentation from their home countries,\u201d Jeffrey said.    He said now that STAR Sabah is in the Federal Government, it is appropriate that they initiate a forum to find the way forward for an all-encompassing solution for this issue in Malaysia, particularly in Sabah. \n                \n                "},

The Malaysian authorities have swept up hundreds of undocumented workers in raids amid its movement control order, while its neighbour Indonesia, home to most of them, is repatriating its citizens. Just as Singapore has struggled to deal with a coronavirus outbreak that spread quickly through its population of foreign workers in dormitories, countries with large numbers of low-wage migrant workers are grappling with similar issues. From Asia to the Middle East, the Covid-19 (coronavirus) pandemic is exposing the unique vulnerabilities of the world's estimated 164 million low-paid migrant workers, who toil at the jobs locals do not want, to save money and get a leg up back home. While some appear to have escaped the same sort of outbreak Singapore is dealing with, activists say good examples of how to manage this segment of their population are few and far between. As Covid-19 takes its toll on economies and public health in many countries, low-wage migrant worker populations have largely been affected disproportionately. Observers say problems include poor living conditions, insufficient legal protection and limited access to healthcare. Last month, Saudi Arabia had shipped home nearly 3,000 of the estimated 200,000 Ethiopians living there before the United Nations called for a halt. In Kuwait last month, at least a dozen migrant workers took their own lives or attempted to, according to migrant-rights.org, an activist website, citing media reports. In Thailand, hundreds of thousands of workers from neighbouring countries like Myanmar, Laos and Cambodia are said to have fled home after a lockdown left them with the prospect of being stuck without money or food. n Malaysia, police rounded up 200 undocumented workers last week alone in Petaling Jaya, outside Kuala Lumpur, even as officials gradually ease movement restrictions. The country is thought to have at least five million migrant workers. Indonesia, one of the world's biggest contributors of labour, has repatriated more than 130,000 of its citizens working abroad as construction workers, cruise ship staff and housekeepers, as well as students. David Welsh, country director of the South-East Asia branch of the Solidarity Centre, a non-profit organisation aligned with the United States-based labour federation AFL-CIO, said the crisis has exposed the poor conditions many migrant workers face. \"Migrant workers have been left aside by governments who have relied on them to do dangerous jobs that have become even more dangerous during this crisis,\" Welsh said. Then, there is Qatar, where observers say criticism of the country's treatment of migrant labour in the wake of its successful bid to host the Fifa World Cup in 2022 has sparked changes that are a lesson to others but also a demonstration of how difficult the process is going to be. Like in Singapore, the outbreak in Qatar has centred on its foreign workers, who outnumber Qataris in the workforce by nearly 20 to one. Total infections have ticked past 40,000 in a country with 2.8 million people. Last October, it abolished exit visas for departing workers and did away with discriminatory laws assigning minimum wages by nationality. The monarchy at the same time abolished the sponsorship rules that tie workers to jobs and make them vulnerable to abuse. The country's new minimum wage laws also override bilateral agreements with countries of origin that can see a Bangladeshi welder, for example, earning two-thirds what a Filipino might. Qatar's ambition to host the World Cup has helped prompt the changes. Shortly after securing the event a decade ago, Qatar publicly promised four weeks' paid leave, overtime and other benefits to workers employed by the contractors awarded work. Contractors erecting more than half a dozen stadiums and other needed infrastructure offer workers attractive terms that meet the scrutiny of activists and unions. Apolinar Tolentino, regional representative for the Building and Wood Workers' International Asia-Pacific, said his union has had regular access to inspect work sites and dormitories where workers are housed four to an air-conditioned room and bunk beds are banned. The visits included group interviews with workers to assess conditions including health and safety, food quality and even Internet speeds. \"Qatar is setting an example in the region of how to treat its migrant labour,\" said Tolentino. But he acknowledges that the improvement has not been even. Earlier this month, the government began easing a two-month lockdown of the sprawling Industrial Area outside of Doha, where hundreds of thousands of workers were holed up in dormitories. The government requires all employers to pay furloughed workers, but there have been reports of workers stranded and begging for food. The problem is fuelled in part by undocumented foreign workers relying on short-term casual work, who do not have regular employers. \"Compliance with standards outside the World Cup projects are more challenging,\" Tolentino said. \"There is almost no direct access by international organisations.\" Last month, Amnesty International and a coalition of non-governmental organisations and trade unions sent letters to Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Bahrain, Kuwait and Oman, raising concerns about migrant workers. Amnesty International's Middle East research director Lynn Maalouf said: \"While some governments made promising commitments to support migrant workers, much more needs to be done to ensure Covid-19 will not result in further human rights violations and greater suffering for migrant workers in these countries.\" - The Straits Times/Asian News Network\n                \n                "},

Senior Minister (Security) Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri Yaakob  (pic ) said even those who entered the country illegally are treated in a humane manner by the Malaysian government.    \u201cForeigners with valid work permits are protected. For example, those working the estates are given housing. Those in other sectors get all kinds of benefits from employers.    \u201cWe take care of their welfare, there is no issue. We acknowledge that we need them for dangerous, dirty and difficult (3D) jobs.    \u201cAs for those who entered the country illegally and do not have valid documents, we have to take action against them. Even then, we do it humanely. When we find that some of them are Covid-19 positive at our depots, we screen all of them -100% - so that they can be saved.    \u201cWe send them to MAEPS (Malaysia Agro Exposition Park Serdang) to be treated. If you check out MAEPS, it is such a nice place and the government has spent millions of ringgit to set it up (as a Covid-19 hospital).    \u201cIf we are worried about an increasing number of positive cases among them, there are two more places they can be placed at. So to call the government inhumane is not fair, \u201d he said.    Ismail Sabri added that the treatment does not change anything about their status.    \u201cThey entered the country illegally and do not have any right to be here. We are in talks with their home countries to take them back. We do not even want to jail them here, \u201d said Ismail Sabri at the National Security Council (MKN)\u2019s daily Covid-19 press conference here.    Ismail Sabri was asked about claims that the Malaysian government had not treated its foreign workers humanely during the Covid-19 pandemic.    On the rounding up of undocumented migrants during the enhanced movement control order (MCO), Ismail Sabri said it had to be done.    \u201cWhen the enhanced MCO is lifted and the barbed wires are removed, the residents of the area are free to move - including those who are undocumented. If we allow them to be free, then it is wrong because they are illegals.    \u201cWe are not taking advantage of them. We send them to our detention depots. If they test negative for Covid-19, we will deport them.    \u201cIt is not nice to accuse Malaysia of mistreatment. In fact, other countries treat them (undocumented migrants) worse. There is no need for politicians or NGOs to act as heroes for undocumented migrants, \u201d he said.    On the capacity of the temporary hospital in MAEPS, Ismail Sabri said it can accommodate 600 patients - with 230 beds in use so far.    \u201cBesides MAEPS, we also have the unused leprosy centre in the Sungai Buloh Hospital and the former maternity wards at the Kuala Lumpur Hospital, giving us a capacity of 1,430 beds, \u201d he said.

Early this week, most of the Covid-19 clusters were discovered at three immigration detention depots and centres (DTIs) in Sepang, Bukit Jalil and Semenyih.    Health director-general Datuk Dr Noor Hisham Abdullah said that of the 172 cases tested positive in the country on Monday, 112 were from the DTIs.    The next day, 173 foreigners tested positive. Thirteen were security guards from Cheras.    The spike in cases, three-digit figures since May 3, has the public concerned but Dr Noor Hisham assured everyone that the DTIs were in isolated areas and under control by local authorities.    On the same day, Senior Minister Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri Yaakob said the government would send DTI detainees to Covid-19 makeshift hospitals and deport those who were free of Covid-19.    Infectious disease consultant Datuk Dr Christopher Lee concurred with Aegile.    \u201cIf we feel they are a major risk group based on their close living conditions, then we need to engage them rather than make them hide from the authorities, \u201d he said.    Dr Lee also said that if the undocumented workers had acquired the infection inside the camps, then the authorities needed to sort out the hygiene and social distancing issues there although it would pose a challenge due to the huge numbers.    \u201cEthically, we still have to try our best to minimise the risks, \u201d he said.    Universiti Malaya senior research consultant academician Emeritus Prof Datuk Dr Lam Sai Kit also said the Immigration Department should not detain undocumented migrants at this stage to prevent overcrowding.    \u201cDetainees should be educated on how the virus is spread and about personal hygiene, including wearing of face masks, \u201d he said.    However, consultant public health physician Datuk Lokman Hakim Sulaiman agreed with the authorities that detaining undocumented workers would help minimise Covid-19\u2019s spread to the general public and those tested negative should be deported.    \u201cWho will foot their bill if all undocumented workers are required to be tested?\u201d he said. \n                \n                "},

He said the police has also detained 136 individuals, of which 75 were remanded while 61 were on bail for defying the conditional movement control order (MCO).    \u201cCompounds were also issued to 534 individuals for various offences under the conditional MCO, \u201d he said.    States that recorded the highest number of attempts to cross borders are Selangor (284), Kedah (122) and Melaka (113).    Ismail Sabri also said that audit firms that instructed their staff to work in different states were breaching the conditional MCO.    \u201cAs I have mentioned previously, interstate travels are only for emergencies such as a death or for close family members to visit those who are very ill.    \u201cAuditors wanting to check accounts of (their clients) is obviously not part of it.

Meanwhile, state investment, industry and trade, small and medium industries committee chairman Datuk Teng Chang Khim said the Selangor government was helping the Health Ministry in its efforts to detect and curb Covid-19 infection among construction workers.    \u201cThe state cannot take the lead on this matter and thus we are doing everything possible to complement the initiatives taken by the ministry, \u2019\u2019 said Teng.    This included having a budget to go towards carrying out screening of construction workers and providing whatever else was required by the Health Ministry.    \u201cFor instance, if the ministry has insufficient personal protective gears, we will provide them with these, \u2019\u2019 said Teng, adding that the Health Ministry was doing the right thing to stem Covid-19 cases in the construction industry.    Teng said sending home undocumented workers who were Covid-19 negative as well as random testing was the only viable option at the moment.    Meanwhile, state health, welfare, women empowerment and family committee chairman Dr Siti Mariah Mahmud said RM2.06mil has been allocated by the Selangor government for screening of high risk groups.    \u201cWe\u2019ll be having a meeting with Mentri Besar Datuk Seri Amirudin Shari, the state health department as well as Selangor Task Force for Covid-19 on June 1 to determine all the high risk groups for screening, \u2019\u2019 said Dr Siti Mariah.    She added that PPEs were also being produced by the state\u2019s Women Development Centre in collaboration with Hospital Banting.    In Sabah, things are rough. Many construction sites are not running due to employers\u2019 inability to get their workers tested for Covid-19.    Sabah Builders Association (SBA) president Lou Chi Nam said that feedback from SBA\u2019s 100-odd members was that most of them would not begin work until June \u2013 and if the conditional MCO were to be over.\u201cOne of the requirements to start operating is that these workers must have gotten tested for the virus and results obtained, \u201d he said. \u201cBut since many are not able to, mainly due to the cost, they cannot operate, \u201d he said.

Federation of Malaysian Manufacturers (FMM) president Tan Sri Soh Thian Lai said the amendments to the Minimum Standards of Housing and Amenities (Amendment) Act was a good decision in the long term as it would ensure conducive housing condition for all workers, and enhance the health and productivity of the workforce in the country.    However, Soh said the amendments, which would come into force on June 1 in Peninsular Malaysia and the Federal Territory of Labuan, could pose some challenges to fulfilling them.    The Human Resources Ministry said the government would give a three-month grace period until Aug 31 to give room for employers to make the necessary arrangements.    The enforcement under the Act will begin on Sept 1. The amendments to the Act was passed in Parliament last July and was gazetted on Sept 18.    \u201cBut with the huge number of foreign workers in Malaysia, around two million documented and about four million undocumented, it could pose a big challenge to fulfil conditions under the amendments of the Act within 15 months, including the three-month grace period as all affected employers who employ foreign workers must comply with it, \u201d said Soh.    \u201cNow that the highest risk clusters of Covid-19 infections are foreign workers, this Act is timely \u2013 but it\u2019s too short a time to get the employers prepared.    \u201cWe urge the authorities to give more time, at least six months, for companies to reset and rearrange according to the standard operating procedure (SOP), \u201d Soh said.    Soh said the government should now focus on the construction sites and quarters of foreign workers in the yellow and red zones as they were the high-risk clusters.    \u201cThe most important thing is for all companies with foreign workers to follow the SOP set by the Health Ministry and authorities to minimise the risks, \u201d he said.    Master Builders Association of Malaysia (MBAM) president Foo Chek Lee said it was in full support of the implementation of the amendment, which it helped to draft years ago.    \u201cA worker needs a good place to stay and rest.    \u201cIf they don\u2019t have proper rest, they can\u2019t work and if their living condition is not good, they will get sick and it affects productivity, \u201d he said.    Foo said big construction companies would not have problems to provide housing according to the guidelines.    He pointed out that some workers, however, were labourers who did not have permanent employment and chose to live in cramped conditions to save money.    \u201cThe main contractor and project owners are liable to provide proper accommodation to foreign workers.    \u201cHowever, some sub-contractors may still resort to providing housing in the form of kongsi or hostel but now they would have to follow the guidelines under the amendments, \u201d he said.    Foo, however, said the grace period was tight as it did not give much time for companies to prepare.    \u201cBut this is an extraordinary time with Covid-19, so companies will have to push and make it happen to safeguard public health, \u201d Foo added.    Real Estate and Housing Developers Association (Rehda) national council member Tony Khoo Boon Chuan said there was confusion on the ground as the detailed SOP was not available.    When asked on the ramification of the amendments, Khoo said the extra cost from providing housing, according to guidelines, would be transferred to home buyers eventually.    \u201cThis will result in more expensive houses and properties, \u201d he said.    Bina Puri Holdings group executive director Matthew Tee said although the amendments came at a cost, the industry would have to manage it.    \u201cWe try to follow the guidelines but all these implementations come at a cost, at a time when the construction sector is undergoing a recession, \u201d said Tee. \n                \n                "},

The Prime Minister said he had been in quarantine at his home in Kuala Lumpur.    \u201cSome have rumoured that I am in Singapore for treatment there. I wish to say that this is not true at all.    \u201cFor your information, I am currently undergoing quarantine at my home in Bukit Damansara, Kuala Lumpur,\" he said on his Facebook on Thursday (May 28).    Muhyiddin has been placed under a 14-day quarantine since last Friday (May 22), after attending a post-Cabinet meeting that was also attended by Auditor-General Datuk Nik Azman Nik Abdul Majid who later tested positive for Covid-19.    In 2018, he was in Singapore to undergo surgery for pancreatic cancer.    In his post, Muhyiddin said he would continue working on strategies to battle the pandemic still plaguing the country.    Meanwhile, he also said he had an online meeting with Senior Minister (Security) Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri Yaakob and Health director-general Datuk Dr Noor Hisham Abdullah to get the latest updates on the Covid-19 situation in the country.    \u201cIn the 40-minute meeting, a few matters were discussed, among them was having a campaign to encourage community leaders to empower their constituents with responsibilities to protect the community from the virus infection.    \u201cI believe this campaign will educate people to be more responsible for adhering the stipulated standard operating procedures (SOPs) and subsequently lessen the burden on frontliners.    \u201cThis is an important step in the exit plan for the conditional movement control order (MCO), which is also the last criteria to fulfil before the order can be lifted,\u201d he said, adding that the meeting also touched on repatriating undocumented migrants who have been tested negative for Covid-19.    He said he had directed that the process be quickened to reduce the risks of infection among the migrants at detention depots.    \u201cI am satisfied with the outcome in our efforts to fight the pandemic as briefed to me.    \u201cWith all citizens cooperating and taking responsibilities to take care of their own communities, I believe we will succeed in ending the Covid-19 chain of infection,\u201d he added.      \n                \n                "},

Its executive director Datuk Shamsuddin Bardan said the government\u2019s decision to enforce the amendment to the Workers\u2019 Minimum Standards of Housing and Amenities Act on June 1 was insensitive and did not take into account the problems faced by employers.    \u201cInstead, the government should assist employers by guiding them and workers on how Covid-19 can be prevented at their quarters.\u201d    The amendment will now include workers from all industries, including construction, with a three-month grace period granted to employers to implement it.    Shamsuddin said the minimum space requirement per worker living in a permanent dwelling is 4.8sq m while temporary dwelling is 3sq m.    \u201cThe space required for individual employees is demanding and costly and yet the maximum allowable charge on accommodation currently is only RM50 per worker, way below the centralised housing cost of RM100 to RM150 at market rate.    \u201cSome employers may have to send home some foreign workers because they don\u2019t have enough financial resources to comply with it,\u201d he said, adding that the government should target undocumented workers in which most Covid-19 cases were detected.    He also said that the grace period was too short as they were trying to cope with the requirements under the conditional movement control order to revive businesses.    Shamsuddin said providing \u201ckongsi\u201d type accommodation at construction sites would no longer be feasible under the new law.    \u201cAccommodation will be further away from construction sites and there is a need to provide transportation, which adds cost and travel time,\u201d he said.    However, Malaysian Medical Association president Dr N. Ganabaskaran welcomed the government\u2019s move, saying that workers should not be living in cramped rooms and a limit must be set on the number of workers per room.    \u201cPhysical distancing and good personal hygiene must be observed. Their accommodation must also be kept clean and disinfected,\u201d he said.    Dr Ganabaskaran said employers should also appoint team leaders to ensure preventive measures were enforced as part of the standard operating procedure (SOP).    \u201cRegular checks at construction sites and foreign workers\u2019 accommodation should be conducted by the authorities,\u201d he said, adding that fines should be issued for non-compliance.    He also said sharing of food and drinks among the workers should not be allowed. \n                \n                "},
